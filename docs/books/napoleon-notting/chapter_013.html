            <h1 id="link-14"><span class="chapter-header">Chapter 1</span><br />The Battle of the Lamps</h1><p id="para-687">Mr. Buck, who, though retired, frequently went down to his big drapery stores in Kensington High Street, was locking up those premises, being the last to leave. It was a wonderful evening of green and gold, but that did not trouble him very much. If you had pointed it out, he would have agreed seriously, for the rich always desire to be artistic.</p>
<p id="para-688">He stepped out into the cool air, buttoning up his light coat, and blowing great clouds, from his cigar, when a figure dashed up to him in another yellow overcoat, but unbuttoned and flying behind him.</p>
<p id="para-689">“Hullo, Barker!” said the draper. “Any of our summer articles? You’re too late. Factory Acts, Barker. Humanity and progress, my boy.”</p>
<p id="para-690">“Oh, don’t chatter,” cried Barker, stamping. “We’ve been beaten.”</p>
<p id="para-691">“Beaten–by what?” asked Buck, mystified.</p>
<p id="para-692">“By Wayne.”</p>
<p id="para-693">Buck looked at Barker’s fierce white face for the first time, as it gleamed in the lamplight.</p>
<p id="para-694">“Come and have a drink,” he said.</p>
<p id="para-695">They adjourned to a cushioned and glaring buffet, and Buck established himself slowly and lazily in a seat, and pulled out his cigar-case.</p>
<p id="para-696">“Have a smoke,” he said.</p>
<p id="para-697">Barker was still standing, and on the fret, but after a moment’s hesitation, he sat down, as if he might spring up again the next minute. They ordered drinks in silence.</p>
<p id="para-698">“How did it happen?” asked Buck, turning his big bold eyes on him.</p>
<p id="para-699">“How the devil do I know?” cried Barker. “It happened like–like a dream. How can two hundred men beat six hundred? How can they?”</p>
<p id="para-700">“Well,” said Buck, coolly. “How did they? You ought to know.”</p>
<div class="image">
  <img src="images/image_3.png" title alt="Map of the Seat of War" />
</div><p id="para-701">“I don’t know. I can’t describe,” said the other, drumming on the table. “It seemed like this. We were six hundred and marched with those damned poleaxes of Auberon’s–the only weapons we’ve got. We marched two abreast. We went up to Holland Walk, between the high palings which seemed to me to go straight as an arrow for Pump Street. I was near the tail of the line and it was a long one. When the end of it was still between the high palings, the head of the line was already crossing Holland Park Avenue. Then the head plunged into the network of narrow streets on the other side, and the tail and myself came out on the great crossing. When we also had reached the northern side and turned up a small street that points, crookedly as it were, towards Pump Street, the whole thing felt different. The streets dodged and bent so much that the head of our line seemed lost altogether: it might as well have been in North America. And all this time we hadn’t seen a soul.”</p>
<p id="para-702">Buck, who was idly dabbing the ash of his cigar on the ash-tray, began to move it deliberately over the table, making feathery grey lines, a kind of map.</p>
<p id="para-703">“But though the little streets were all deserted (which got a trifle on my nerves), as we got deeper and deeper into them, a thing began to happen that I couldn’t understand. Sometimes a long way ahead–three turns or corners ahead, as it were–there broke suddenly a sort of noise, clattering, and confused cries, and then stopped. Then, when it happened, something, I can’t describe it–a kind of shake or stagger went down the line, as if the line were a live thing, whose head had been struck, or had been an electric cord. None of us knew why we were moving, but we moved and jostled. Then we recovered, and went on through the little dirty streets, round corners, and up twisted ways. The little crooked streets began to give me a feeling I can’t explain–as if it were a dream. I felt as if things had lost their reason, and we should never get out of the maze. Odd to hear me talk like that, isn’t it? The streets were quite well-known streets, all down on the map. But the fact remains. I wasn’t afraid of something happening. I was afraid of nothing ever happening–nothing ever happening for all God’s eternity.”</p>
<p id="para-704">He drained his glass and called for more whisky. He drank it and went on.</p>
<p id="para-705">“And then something did happen. Buck, it’s the solemn truth, that nothing has ever happened to you in your life. Nothing had ever happened to me in my life.”</p>
<p id="para-706">“Nothing ever happened!” said Buck, staring. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p id="para-707">“Nothing has ever happened,” repeated Barker, with a morbid obstinacy. “You don’t know what a thing happening means? You sit in your office expecting customers, and customers come; you walk in the street expecting friends, and friends meet you; you want a drink and get it; you feel inclined for a bet and make it. You expect either to win or lose, and you do either one or the other. But things happening!” and he shuddered ungovernably.</p>
<p id="para-708">“Go on,” said Buck, shortly. “Get on.”</p>
<p id="para-709">“As we walked wearily round the corners, something happened. When something happens, it happens first, and you see it afterwards. It happens of itself, and you have nothing to do with it. It proves a dreadful thing–that there are other things besides one’s self. I can only put it in this way. We went round one turning, two turnings, three turnings, four turnings, five. Then I lifted myself slowly up from the gutter where I had been shot half senseless, and was beaten down again by living men crashing on top of me, and the world was full of roaring, and big men rolling about like nine-pins.”</p>
<p id="para-710">Buck looked at his map with knitted brows.</p>
<p id="para-711">“Was that Portobello Road?” he asked.</p>
<p id="para-712">“Yes,” said Barker. “Yes; Portobello Road–I saw it afterwards; but, my God–what a place it was! Buck, have you ever stood and let a six foot of a man lash and lash at your head with six feet of pole with six pounds of steel at the end? Because, when you have had that experience, as Walt Whitman says, ‘you re-examine philosophies and religions.’”</p>
<p id="para-713">“I have no doubt,” said Buck. “If that was Portobello Road, don’t you see what happened?”</p>
<p id="para-714">“I know what happened exceedingly well. I was knocked down four times; an experience which, as I say, has an effect on the mental attitude. And another thing happened, too. I knocked down two men. After the fourth fall (there was not much bloodshed–more brutal rushing and throwing-for nobody could use their weapons), after the fourth fall, I say, I got up like a devil, and I tore a poleaxe out of a man’s hand and struck where I saw the scarlet of Wayne’s fellows, struck again and again. Two of them went over, bleeding on the stones, thank God–and I laughed and found myself sprawling in the gutter again, and got up again, and struck again, and broke my halberd to pieces. I hurt a man’s head, though.”</p>
<p id="para-715">Buck set down his glass with a bang, and spat out curses through his thick moustache.</p>
<p id="para-716">“What is the matter?” asked Barker, stopping, for the man had been calm up to now, and now his agitation was far more violent than his own.</p>
<p id="para-717">“The matter?” said Buck, bitterly; “don’t you see how these maniacs have got us? Why should two idiots, one a clown and the other a screaming lunatic, make sane men so different from themselves? Look here, Barker; I will give you a picture. A very well-bred young man of this century is dancing about in a frock-coat. He has in his hands a nonsensical seventeenth century halberd, with which he is trying to kill men in a street in Netting Hill. Damn it! don’t you see how they’ve got us? Never mind how you felt–that is how you looked. The King would put his cursed head on one side and call it exquisite. The Provost of Netting Hill would put his cursed nose in the air and call it heroic. But in Heaven’s name what would you have called it–two days before?”</p>
<p id="para-718">Barker bit his lip.</p>
<p id="para-719">“You haven’t been through it, Buck,” he said. “You don’t understand righting–the atmosphere.”</p>
<p id="para-720">“I don’t deny the atmosphere,” said Buck, striking the table. “I only say it’s their atmosphere. It’s Adam Wayne’s atmosphere. It’s the atmosphere which you and I thought had vanished from an educated world for ever.”</p>
<p id="para-721">“Well, it hasn’t,” said Barker; “and if you have any lingering doubts, lend me a poleaxe and I’ll show you.”</p>
<p id="para-722">There was a long silence, and then Buck turned to his neighbour and spoke in that good-tempered tone that comes of a power of looking facts in the face; the tone in which he concluded great bargains.</p>
<p id="para-723">“Barker,” he said, “you are right. This old thing–this fighting, has come back. It has come back suddenly and taken us by surprise. So it is first blood to Adam Wayne. But, unless reason and arithmetic and everything else have gone crazy, it must be next and last blood to us. But when an issue has really arisen, there is only one thing to do–to study that issue as such and win in it. Barker, since it is fighting, we must understand fighting. I must understand fighting as coolly and completely as I understand drapery; you must understand fighting as coolly and completely as you understand politics. Now, look at the facts. I stick without hesitation to my original formula. Fighting, when we have the stronger force, is only a matter of arithmetic. It must be. You asked me just now how two hundred men could defeat six hundred. I can tell you. Two hundred men can defeat six hundred when the six hundred behave like fools. When they forget the very conditions they are fighting in; when they fight in a swamp as if it were a mountain; when they fight in a forest as if it were a plain; when they fight in streets without remembering the object of streets.”</p>
<p id="para-724">“What is the object of streets?” asked Barker.</p>
<p id="para-725">“What is the object of supper?” cried Buck, furiously. “Isn’t it obvious? This military science is mere common sense. The object of a street is to lead from one place to another; therefore all streets join; therefore street fighting is quite a peculiar thing. You advanced into that hive of streets as if you were advancing into an open plain where you could see everything. Instead of that you were advancing into the bowels of a fortress, with streets pointing at you, streets turning on you, streets jumping out at you, and all in the hands of the enemy. Do you know what Portobello Road is? It is the only point on your journey where two side streets run up opposite each other. Wayne massed his men on the two sides, and when he had let enough of your line go past, cut it in two like a worm. Don’t you see what would have saved you?”</p>
<p id="para-726">Barker shook his head.</p>
<p id="para-727">“Can’t your ‘atmosphere’ help you?” asked Buck, bitterly. “Must I attempt explanations in the romantic manner? Suppose that, as you were righting blindly with the red Notting Killers who imprisoned you on both sides, you had heard a shout from behind them. Suppose, oh, romantic Barker! that behind the red tunics you had seen the blue and gold of South Kensington taking them in the rear, surrounding them in their turn and hurling them on to your halberds.”</p>
<p id="para-728">“If the thing had been possible,” began Barker, cursing.</p>
<p id="para-729">“The thing would have been as possible,” said Buck, simply; “as simple as arithmetic. There are a certain number of street entries that lead to Pump Street. There are not nine hundred; there are not nine million. They do not grow in the night. They do not increase like mushrooms. It must be possible with such an overwhelming force as we have to advance by all of them at once. In every one of the arteries, or approaches, we can put almost as many men as Wayne can put into the field altogether. Once do that and we have him to demonstration. It is like a proposition in Euclid.”</p>
<p id="para-730">“You think that is certain,” said Barker, anxious but dominated delightfully.</p>
<p id="para-731">“I’ll tell you what I think,” said Buck, getting up jovially. “I think Adam Wayne made an uncommonly spirited little fight. And I think I am confoundedly sorry for him.”</p>
<p id="para-732">“Buck, you are a great man,” cried Barker, rising also. “You’ve knocked me sensible again. I am ashamed to say it, but I was getting romantic. Of course, what you say is adamantine sense. Fighting, being physical, must be mathematical. We were beaten because we were neither mathematical nor physical nor anything else–because we deserved to be beaten. Hold all the approaches, and with our force we must have him. When shall we open the next campaign?”</p>
<p id="para-733">“Now,” said Buck, and walked out of the bar.</p>
<p id="para-734">“Now!” cried Barker, following him eagerly. “Do you mean now? It is so late.”</p>
<p id="para-735">Buck turned on him, stamping.</p>
<p id="para-736">“Do you think fighting is under the Factory Acts?” he said. And he called a cab. “Netting Hill Gate Station,” he said, and the two drove off.</p>
<p id="para-737">A genuine reputation can sometimes be made in an hour. Buck, in the next sixty or eighty minutes showed himself a really great man of action. His cab carried him like a thunderbolt from the King to Wilson, from Wilson to Swindon, from Swindon to Barker again; if his course was jagged, it had the jaggedness of the lightning. Only two things he carried with him, his inevitable cigar and the map of North Kensington and Notting Hill. There were, as he again and again pointed out, with every variety of persuasion and violence, only nine possible ways of approaching Pump Street within a quarter of a mile around it; three out of Westbourne Grove, two out of Ladbroke Grove, and four out of Notting Hill High Street. And he had detachments of two hundred each, stationed at every one of the entrances before the last green of that strange sunset had sunk out of the black sky.</p>
<p id="para-738">The sky was particularly black, and on this alone was one false protest raised against the triumphant optimism of the Provost of North Kensington. He overruled it with his infectious common sense.</p>
<p id="para-739">“There is no such thing,” he said, “as night in London. You have only to follow the line of street lamps. Look, here is the map. Two hundred purple North Kensington soldiers under myself march up Ossington Street, two hundred more under Captain Bruce. of the North Kensington Guard, up Clanricarde Gardens.<a href="#note-dest-1"><sup id="note-source-1">[1]</sup></a> Two hundred yellow West Kensingtons under Provost Swindon attack from Pernbridge Road. Two hundred more of my men from the eastern streets, leading away from Queen’s Road. Two detachments of yellows enter by two roads from Westbourne Grove. Lastly, two hundred green Bayswaters come down from the North through Chepstow Place, and two hundred more under Provost Wilson himself, through the upper part of Pembridge Road. Gentlemen, it is mate in two moves. The enemy must either mass in Pump Street and be cut to pieces–or they must retreat past the Gaslight &amp; Coke Co.–and rush on my four hundred–or they must retreat past St. Luke’s Church and rush on the six hundred from the West. Unless we are all mad, it’s plain. Come on. To your quarters and await Captain Bruce’s signal to advance. Then you have only to walk up a line of gas-lamps and smash this nonsense by pure mathematics. Tomorrow we shall be all civilians again."</p>
<p id="para-740">His optimism glowed like a great fire in the night, and ran round the terrible ring in which Wayne was now held helpless. The fight was already over. One man’s energy for one hour had saved the city from war.</p>
<p id="para-741">For the next ten minutes Buck walked up and down silently beside the motionless clump of his two hundred. He had not changed his appearance in any way, except to sling across his yellow overcoat a case with a revolver in it. So that his light-clad modern figure showed up oddly beside the pompous purple uniforms of his halberdiers, which darkly but richly coloured the black night.</p>
<p id="para-742">At length a shrill trumpet rang from some way up the street; it was the signal of advance. Buck briefly gave the word, and the whole purple line, with its dimly shining steel, moved up the side alley. Before it was a slope of street, long, straight, and shining in the dark. It was a sword pointed at Pump Street, the heart at which nine other swords were pointed that night.</p>
<p id="para-743">A quarter of an hour’s silent marching brought them almost within earshot of any tumult in the doomed citadel. But still there was no sound and no sign of the enemy. This time, at any rate, they knew that they were closing in on it mechanically, and they marched on under the lamplight and the dark without any of that eerie sense of ignorance which Barker had felt when entering the hostile country by one avenue alone.</p>
<p id="para-744">“Halt point arms!” cried Buck, suddenly, and as he spoke there came a clatter of feet tumbling along the stones. But the halberds were levelled in vain. The figure that rushed up was a messenger from the contingent of the North.</p>
<p id="para-745">“Victory, Mr. Buck!” he cried, panting, “they are ousted. Provost Wilson of Bayswater has taken Pump Street.”</p>
<p id="para-746">Buck ran forward in his excitement.</p>
<p id="para-747">“Then, which way are they retreating? It must be either by St. Luke’s to meet Swindon, or by the Gas Company to meet us. Run like mad to Swindon and see that the yellows are holding the St. Luke’s Road. We will hold this, never fear. We have them in an iron trap. Rim!”</p>
<p id="para-748">As the messenger dashed away into the dar ness, the great guard of North Kensington swung on with the certainty of a machine. Yet scarcely a hundred yards further their halberd points again fell in line gleaming in the gas-light. For again a clatter of feet was heard on the stones, and again it proved to be only the messenger.</p>
<p id="para-749">“Mr. Provost,” he said, “the yellow West Kensingtons have been holding the road by St. Luke’s for twenty minutes since the capture of Pump Street. Pump Street is not two hundred yards away, they cannot be retreating down that road.”</p>
<p id="para-750">“Then they are retreating down this!” said Provost Buck, with a final cheerfulness, “and by good fortune down a well-lighted road, though it twists about. Forward!”</p>
<p id="para-751">As they moved along the last three hundred yards of their journey, Buck fell, for the first time in his life, perhaps, into a kind of philosophical reverie, for men of his type are always made kindly, and as it were melancholy, by success.</p>
<p id="para-752">“I am sorry for poor old Wayne, I really am,” he thought. “He spoke up splendidly for me at that Council. And he blacked old Barker’s eye with considerable spirit. But I don’t see what a man can expect when he fights against arithmetic, to say nothing of civilisation. And what a wonderful hoax all this military genius is. I suspect I’ve just discovered what Cromwell discovered, that a sensible tradesman is the best general, and that a man who can buy men and sell men can lead and kill them. The thing’s simply like adding up a column in a ledger. If Wayne has two hundred men, he can’t put two hundred men in nine places at once. If they’re ousted from Pump Street they’re flying somewhere. If they’re not flying past the church they’re flying past the Works. And so we have them. We business men should have no chance at all except that cleverer people than we get bees in their bonnets that prevent them from reasoning properly so we reason alone. And so I, who am comparatively stupid, see things as God sees them, as a vast machine. My God, what’s this?” And he clapped his hands to his eyes and staggered back.</p>
<p id="para-753">Then through the darkness he cried in a dreadful voice–</p>
<p id="para-754">“Did I blaspheme God?–I am struck blind.”</p>
<p id="para-755">“What?” wailed another voice behind him, the voice of a certain Wilfred Jarvis of North Kensington.</p>
<p id="para-756">“Blind!” cried Buck; “blind!”</p>
<p id="para-757">“I’m blind, too!” cried Jarvis, in an agony.</p>
<p id="para-758">“Fools, all of you,” said a gross voice behind them; “we’re all blind. The lamps have gone out.”</p>
<p id="para-759">“The lamps–but why? where?” cried Buck, turning furiously in the darkness. “How are we to get on? How are we to chase the enemy? Where have they gone?”</p>
<p id="para-760">“The enemy went–” said the rough voice behind, and then stopped, doubtfully.</p>
<p id="para-761">“Where?” shouted Buck, stamping like a madman.</p>
<p id="para-762">“They went,” said the gruff voice, “past the Gas Works, and they’ve used their chance.”</p>
<p id="para-763">“Great God!” thundered Buck, and snatched at his revolver; “do you mean they’ve turned out–”</p>
<p id="para-764">But almost before he had spoken the words, he was hurled like a stone from a catapult into the midst of his own men.</p>
<p id="para-765">“Notting Hill! Notting Hill!” cried frightful voices out of the darkness, and they seemed to come from all sides, for the men of North Kensington, unacquainted with the road, had lost all their bearings in the black world of blindness.</p>
<p id="para-766">“Notting Hill! Notting Hill!” cried the invisible people, and the invaders were hewn down horribly with black steel, with steel that gave no glint against any light.</p>
<p id="para-767">Buck, though badly maimed with the blow of a halberd, kept an angry but splendid sanity. He groped madly for the wall and found it. Struggling with crawling fingers along it, he found a side opening and retreated into it with the remnants of his men. Their adventures during that prodigious night are not to be described. They did not know whether they were going towards or away from the enemy. Not knowing where they themselves were, or where their opponents were, it was mere irony to ask where was the rest of their army. For a thing had descended upon them which London does not know–darkness, which was before the stars were made, and they were as much lost in it as if they had been made before the stars. Every now and then, as those frightful hours wore on, they buffeted in the darkness against living men, who struck at them and at whom they struck, with an idiot fury. When at last the grey dawn came, they found they had wandered back to the edge of the Uxbridge Road. They found that in those horrible eyeless encounters, the North Kensingtons and the Bayswaters and the West Kensingtons had again and again met and butchered each other, and they heard that Adam Wayne was barricaded in Pump Street.</p>
