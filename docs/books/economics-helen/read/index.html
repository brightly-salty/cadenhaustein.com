<h1>The Elements</h1>
<p>Economics is the name which people have come to give to the study of
Wealth. It is the study by which we learn how Wealth is produced, how it
is consumed, how it is distributed among people, and so on. It is a very
important kind of study, because it often depends upon our being right
or wrong in Economics whether we make the whole State poorer or richer,
and whether we make the people living in the State happier or not.</p>
<p>Now as Economics is the study of Wealth, the first thing we have to
make certain of is, <em>What Wealth is</em>.</p>
<section id="what-is-wealth" class="level2">
<h2>What is Wealth?</h2>
<p>The Economic definition of Wealth is subtle and difficult to
appreciate, but it is absolutely essential to our study to get it clear
at the outset and keep it firmly in mind. It is through some muddlement
in this original definition of wealth that nearly all mistakes in
Economics are made.</p>
<p>First, we must be clear as to what Wealth is <em>not.</em></p>
<p>Wealth is never properly defined, for the purposes of economic study,
by any one of the answers a person would naturally give off-hand. For
instance, most people would say that a man’s wealth was the money he was
worth. But that, of course, is nonsense; for even if there were no money
used his possessions would still be there, and if he had a house and
cattle and horses the mere fact that money was not being used where he
lived would not make him any worse off.</p>
<p>Another and better, but still a wrong, answer is: “Wealth is what a
man possesses.”</p>
<p>For instance, in the case of this farmer, his house and his stock and
his furniture and implements are what we call his “wealth.” In ordinary
talk that answer will do well enough. But it will not do for the strict
science of Economics, for it is not accurate.</p>
<p>For consider a particular case. Part of this man’s wealth is, you
say, a certain grey horse. But if you look closely at your definition
and make it rigidly accurate, you will find that <em>it is not the horse
itself which constitutes his wealth, but something attaching to the
horse,</em> some quality or circumstance which affects the horse and
gives the horse what is called its <em>value.</em> It is this
<em>Value</em> which is wealth, not the horse. To see how true this is
consider how the value changes while the horse remains the same.</p>
<p>On such and such a date any neighbour would have given the owner of
the horse from 20 to 25 sacks of wheat for it, or, say, 10 sheep, or 50
loads of cut wood. But suppose there comes a great mortality among
horses, so that very few are left. There is an eager desire to get hold
of those that survive in order that the work may be done on the farms.
Then the neighbours will be willing to give the owner of the horse much
more than 20 or 25 sacks of wheat for it. They may offer as much as 50
sacks, or 20 sheep, or 100 loads of wood. Yet the horse is exactly the
same horse it was before. The wealth of the master has increased. His
horse, as we say, is “worth more.” <em>It is this</em>
<strong>Worth</strong>, <em>that is, this ability to get other wealth in
exchange, which constitutes true Economic Wealth.</em></p>
<p>I have told you that the idea is very difficult to seize, and that
you will find the hardest part of the study here, at the beginning.
There is no way of making it plainer. One has no choice but to master
the idea and make oneself familiar with it, difficult as it is.
<em>Wealth does not reside in the objects we possess, but in the
economic values attaching to those objects.</em></p>
<p>We talk of a man’s wealth or a nation’s wealth, or the wealth of the
whole world, and we think at once, of course, of a lot of material
things: houses and ships, and pictures and furniture, and food and all
the rest of it. But the economic wealth which it is our business to
study is not identical with those <em>things.</em> Wealth is the sum
total of the <em>values</em> attaching to those things.</p>
<p>That is the first and most important point.</p>
<p>Here is the second: Wealth, for the purposes of economic study,
<em>is confined to those values attaching to material objects through
the action of man, which values can be exchanged for other
values.</em></p>
<p>I will explain what that sentence means.</p>
<p>Here is a mountain country where there are few people and plenty of
water everywhere. That water does not form part of the Economic
<em>wealth</em> of anyone living there. Everyone is the better off for
the water, but no one has <em>wealth</em> in it. The water they have is
absolutely necessary to life, but no man will give anything for it
because any man can get it for himself. It has no <em>value in
exchange.</em> But in a town to which water has to be brought at great
expense of effort, and where the amount is limited, it acquires a value
in exchange, that is, people cannot get it without offering something
for it. That is why we say that in a modern town water forms part of
<em>Economic Wealth,</em> while in the country it usually does not.</p>
<p>We must carefully note that wealth thus defined is NOT the same thing
as well-being. The mixing up of these two separate things—well-being and
economic wealth—–has given rise to half the errors in economic science.
People confuse the word “wealth” with the idea of well-being. They say:
“Surely a man is better off with plenty of water than with little, and
therefore conditions under which he can get plenty of water for nothing
are conditions under which he has <em>more wealth</em> than when he has
to pay for it. He has more <em>wealth</em> when he gets the water free
than he has when he has to pay for it.”</p>
<p>It is not so. Economic wealth is a separate thing from well-being.
Economic wealth may well be increasing though the general well-being of
the people is going down. It may increase though the general well-being
of the people around it is stationary.</p>
<p>The Science of Economics does not deal with true happiness nor even
with well-being in material things. It deals with a strictly limited
field of what is called “Economic Wealth,” and if it goes outside its
own boundaries it goes wrong. Making people as happy as possible is much
more than Economics can pretend to. Economics cannot even tell you how
to make people well-to-do in material things. But it can tell you how
exchangeable Wealth is produced and what happens to it; and as it can
tell you this, it is a useful servant.</p>
<p>That is the second difficult point at the very beginning of our
study. <em>Economic Wealth consists in</em>
<strong>exchangeable</strong> <em>values, and nothing else.</em></p>
<p>We must be as clear on this second point as we have made ourselves
upon the first, or we 9 hall not make any progress in Economics. They
are both of them unfamiliar ideas, and one has to go over them many
times before one really grasps them. But they are absolutely essential
to this science.</p>
<p>Let us sum up this first, elementary, part of our subject, and put it
in the shortest terms we can find—–what are called “Formulae,” which
means short and exact definitions, such as can be learnt by heart and
retained permanently.</p>
<p>We write down, then, two Formulae:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Wealth is made up, not of things, but of economic values
attaching to things.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wealth, for the purposes of economic study, means ONLY
exchange values: that is, values against which other values will be
given in exchange.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<section id="the-three-things-necessary-to-the-production-of-wealthland-labour-and-capital" class="level2">
<h2>The Three Things Necessary to the Production of Wealth—Land, Labour
and Capital</h2>
<p>You will notice that all about you living beings are occupied in
changing the things around them from a condition where they are
<em>less</em> to a condition where they are <em>more</em> useful to
themselves.</p>
<p>Man is a living being, and he is doing this kind of thing all the
time. If he were not he could not live.</p>
<p>He draws air into his lungs, taking it from a condition where it does
him no good to a condition where it keeps him alive. He sows seed; he
brings food from a distance; he cooks it for his eating. To give himself
shelter from the weather he moulds bricks out of clay and puts them
together into houses. To get himself warmth he cuts down wood and brings
it to his hearth, or he sinks a shaft and gets coal out of the earth,
and so on.</p>
<p>Man is perpetually changing the things- around him from a condition
in which they are <em>less</em> useful to him into a condition where
they are <em>more</em> useful to him.</p>
<p><em>Whenever a man does that he is said to be creating, and adding
to, Human Wealth:</em> part of which is Economic Wealth, that is Wealth
suitable for study under the science of Economics.</p>
<p>Wealth, therefore, that thing the nature and growth of which we are
about to study, is, so far as man is concerned, the result of this
process of changing things to man’s use, and it is through looking
closely at the nature of this process that we get to understand what is
necessary to it, and what impedes it, and how its results are
distributed among mankind.</p>
<p>We must next go on to think out <em>how</em> wealth is so produced.
We have already seen what the general statement on this is: Wealth is
produced by man’s consciously transforming things around him to his own
uses; and though not everything so transformed has true <em>Economic
Wealth</em> attaching to it (for instance, breathing in air does not
produce Economic Wealth), yet all Economic Wealth is produced as
<em>part</em> of this general process.</p>
<p>Now when we come to examine the Production of Wealth, we shall find
that <em>three</em> great separate forces come into it; and these we
shall find to be called conveniently “Land,” “Labour” and “Capital.”</p>
<p>Let us take a particular case of the production of Economic Wealth
and see how it goes forward. Let us take the case of the production of,
say, 100 sacks of wheat.</p>
<section id="land" class="level3">
<h3>1. Land</h3>
<p>A man finds himself possessed of so much land, and when he sets out
to produce the 100 sacks of wheat, the following are the conditions
before him.</p>
<p>There are natural forces of which he takes advantage and without
which he could not grow wheat. The soil he has to do with has a certain
fertility, there is enough rainfall to make the seeds sprout, and so
on.</p>
<p>All these natural forces are obviously necessary to him. Though we
talk of man “creating” wealth he does not really create anything. What
he does is to use and combine certain natural forces of which he is
aware. He has found out that wheat will sprout if it is put into the
ground at a particular season, and that he will get his best result by
preparing the ground in a particular manner, etc. These natural forces
are the foundation of the whole affair.</p>
<p>For the sake of shortness we call all this bundle of natural forces
(which are the very first essential to the making of wealth)
“<strong>LAND</strong>.” This word “Land” is only a conventional term in
Economics, meant to include a vast number of things beside the soil:
things which are not Land at all; for instance, water power and wind
power, the fertility of seed, the force of electricity, and thousands of
other natural energies. But we must have some short convenient term for
this set of things, and the term “Land” having become the conventional
term in Economic Science for all natural forces, it is now the useful
and short word always used for them as a whole: the reason being, I
suppose, that land, or soil, is the first natural requisite for
food—–the most important of man’s requirements, and the <em>place</em>
from which he uses all other natural forces.</p>
<p>We say, then, that for the production of wealth the first thing you
need is the natural forces of the world, or “Land.”</p>
</section>
<section id="labour" class="level3">
<h3>2. Labour</h3>
<p>But we next note that this possession of natural forces, our
knowledge of how they will work, and our power of combining them, <em>is
not enough to produce wealth.</em></p>
<p>If the farmer were to stand still, satisfied with his knowledge of
the fertility of the soil, the quality of seed, and all the rest of it,
he would have no harvest. He must, as we have said, prepare the land and
sow the seed: only so will he get a harvest at the end of his work.
These operations of human energy which end in his getting his harvest
are called “LABOUR”: that is, <em>the application of human energy to
natural forces.</em> There are no conditions whatsoever under which
wealth can be produced without natural forces or “land;” but there are
also no conditions whatsoever under which it can be produced without
“labour,” that is, the use of human energy. Even if a man were in such a
position that he could get his food by picking it off the trees, there
would still be the effort required of picking it. We say, therefore,
that <em>all wealth comes from the combination of LAND and LABOUR: That
is,</em> of <em>natural forces</em> and <em>human energy.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="capital" class="level3">
<h3>3. Capital</h3>
<p>At first sight it looks as though these two elements, Land and
Labour, were all that was needed; and a very great deal of trouble has
been caused in the world by people jumping to this conclusion without
further examination.</p>
<p>But if we look closely into the matter we shall see that Land and
Labour alone are <em>not</em> sufficient to the production of wealth in
any appreciable amount. The moment man begins to produce wealth in any
special fashion and to any appreciable extent, a third element comes in
which is as rigorously necessary as the two others; and that third
element is called CAPITAL.</p>
<p>Let us see what this word “CAPITAL” means.</p>
<p>Here is your farmer with all the requisite knowledge and the natural
forces at his disposal. He has enough good land provided him to produce
a harvest of 100 sacks of wheat if he is able and willing to apply his
manual labour and intelligence to this land. But he must be kept alive
during the many months required for the growth of the wheat. It is no
use his beginning operations, therefore, unless he has a stock of food;
for if he had not such a stock he would die before the harvest was
gathered. Again, he must have seed. He must have enough seed to produce
at the end of those months one hundred sacks of wheat. So we see that at
the very least, for this particular case of production, the natural
forces about him and his own energies would not be of the least use to
the production of the harvest unless there were this third thing, a
stock of wheat both for sowing and for eating.</p>
<p>But that is not all. He must be sheltered from the weather; he must
be clothed and he must have a house, otherwise he would die before the
harvest was gathered. Again, though he might grow a very little wheat by
putting in what seed he could with his hands into a few suitable places
in the soil, he could not get anything like the harvest he was working
for unless he had special implements. He must prepare the land with a
plough; so he must have a plough; and he must have horses to draw the
plough; and those horses must be kept alive while they are working,
until the next harvest comes in; so he must have a stock of oats to feed
them with.</p>
<p>All this means quite a large accumulation of wealth before he can
expect a good harvest: the wealth attaching to clothes, houses, food,
ploughs, horses for a year.</p>
<p>In general, we find that man, when he is setting out on a particular
piece of production of wealth, is absolutely compelled to add to his
energies, and to the natural forces at his disposal, a third element
consisting of <em>certain accumulations of wealth made in the
past</em>—an accumulation of food, clothing, implements, etc.—without
which the process of production could not be undertaken. <em>This
accumulation of</em> <strong>already-made wealth</strong>, <em>which is
thus absolutely necessary to production,</em> we call CAPITAL.</p>
<p>It includes <em>all kinds of wealth whatsoever which man uses</em>
<strong>with the object of producing further wealth,</strong> <em>and
without which the further wealth could not be produced.</em> It is a
reserve without which the process of production is impossible. Later on
we shall see how very important this fact is: for every healthy man has
energy, and natural forces are open to all, but <em>capital</em> can
sometimes be controlled by very few men. If they will not allow their
capital to be used, wealth cannot be produced by the rest; therefore
those who, by their labour, produce wealth may be driven to very hard
conditions by the few owners of Capital, whose leave is necessary for
any wealth to be produced at all.</p>
<p>But all this we must leave to a later part of our study. For the
moment what we have to get clearly into our heads are these three
things: (1) <em>Natural Forces,</em> (2) <em>Human Energy,</em> and (3)
<em>Accumulated stores and implements,</em> which are called, generally,
for the sake of shortness: <em>LAND</em>, <em>LABOUR</em> and
<em>CAPITAL</em>. In the absence of any one of these three, production
of Wealth is impossible. All three must be present; and it is only the
combination of all three which makes the process of producing economic
values possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="points-about-capital" class="level3">
<h3>Points about capital</h3>
<p>There are <em>three</em> important things to remember about
Capital.</p>
<p>1. The first is that what makes a particular piece of wealth into
capital is not the kind of object to which the economic value attaches,
but the <em>intention</em> of using it as capital on the part of the
person who controls that object; that is, the intention to use it for
the <em>production of future wealth.</em> Almost any object can be used
as capital, but no object is capital, however suitable it be for that
purpose, <em>unless there is the intention present of using it as
capital.</em> For instance: One might think that a factory power engine
was always Capital. The economic values attaching to it, which make an
engine worth what it is are nearly always used for the production of
future wealth, and so we come to think of the engine as being
necessarily capital simply because it is an engine, and the same is true
of factory buildings and all other machinery and all tools, such as
hammers and saws and so on.</p>
<p>But these things are not capital <em>in themselves;</em> for if we do
not use them for the production of future wealth they cease to be
capital. For instance, if you were to put the engine into a museum, or
to keep a hammer in remembrance of someone and not use it, then it would
not be capital.</p>
<p>And this truth works the other way about. At first sight you would
say, for instance, that a diamond ring could not be capital: it is only
a luxurious ornament. But if you use it to cut glass for mending a
window it is capital for that purpose.</p>
<p>2. The second important thing to remember about Capital is that,
being Wealth, <em>it is at last consumed, as all other Wealth is.</em>
Capital is consumed in the process of using it to make more Wealth, and
as it is consumed it has to be replaced, or the process of production
will break down. Take the case of the farmer we gave just now. He had to
start, as we saw, with so much Capital—horses and a plough and a stock
of wheat and a stock of oats, etc.; and only by the use of this capital
could he procure his harvest of 100 sacks of wheat at the end of the
year; but if he is going on producing wheat year after year he must
replace the wastage in his capital year after year. His stock of wheat
for food and for seed will have disappeared in the year; so will his
stock of hay and oats for keeping his horses. His plough will be
somewhat worn and will need mending; and his horses, after a certain
time, will grow old and will have to be replaced. Therefore, if
production is to be continuous, that is, if there are to be harvests
year after year, each harvest must be at least enough to replace all the
wastage of capital which goes on during the process of production.</p>
<p>3. The third thing to remember about Capital is that Capital is
<em>always the result of saving:</em> That is, the only way in which
people can get Capital is by doing without some immediate enjoyment of
goods, and putting them by to use them up in creating wealth for the
future. This ought to be self-evident; but people often forget it,
because the person who <em>controls</em> the capital is very often quite
a different person from the person who <em>really accumulated</em> it.
The owner of the capital is very often a person who never thinks of
saving. Nevertheless, the saving has been done by someone in the past,
and saving must go on the whole time, for if it did not the Capital
could not come into existence, and could not be maintained once it was
in existence.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, a man inherits £10,000 worth of Capital
invested in a Steamship Company.</p>
<p>This means that he has a share in a number of hulls, engines, stocks
of coal and food, and clothing for the crews, and other things which
have to be provided before the steamships can go to sea and create
wealth by so doing.</p>
<p>All this capital has been saved by someone. Not by the man himself;
he has merely inherited the wealth—but by someone.</p>
<p>Someone at some time, his father or whoever first got the capital
together, must have forgone immediate enjoyment and put by wealth for
future production, or the capital could not have come into existence.
Thus, if the first accumulator of the capital had used his wealth for
the purchase of a yacht in which to travel for his amusement, the labour
and natural forces used in the production of that yacht would have made
wealth consumed in immediate enjoyment, and it would not have been used
for future production as is a cargo ship.</p>
<p>In the same way this capital, once it has come into existence in the
shape of cargo ships and stocks of coal and the rest, would soon
disappear if it were not perpetually replenished by further saving. The
man who owns the shares in the Steamship Company does not consciously
save year after year enough money to keep the capital at its original
level.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the saving is done for him. The Directors of the
Company keep back out of the total receipts enough to repair the ships
and to replenish the stocks of coal, etc., and they are thus perpetually
accumulating fresh capital to replace the consumption of the old. How
true it is that all Capital is the result of saving by <em>someone,
somewhere,</em> we see in the difference between countries that do a lot
of saving and countries that do little. Savages and people of a low
civilisation differ in this very much from people of a high
civilisation. They want to enjoy what they have the moment they have it,
and they lay by as little as possible for the future; only just as much
as will keep them going. But in a high civilisation people save capital
more and more, and so are able to produce more and more wealth.</p>
<p>Now let us sum up in some more Formulae what we have learnt so
far:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>All production of Wealth needs three things:</strong> (a)
<strong>Natural forces,</strong> (b) <strong>Human energy, and</strong>
(c) <strong>an Accumulation of wealth made in the past and used up in
future production.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>These three are called, for shortness:</strong> (a)
<strong>Land,</strong> (b) <strong>Labour,</strong> (c)
<strong>Capital.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The last, Capital,</strong> (a) <strong>depends for its
character on the intention of the user,</strong> (b) <strong>is consumed
in production,</strong> (c) <strong>is always the result of
saving.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<section id="the-process-of-production" class="level2">
<h2>The Process of Production</h2>
<p>You have seen how the production of wealth takes place through the
combination of these three things, LAND, LABOUR AND CAPITAL, and you
have also seen how the wealth so produced consists not in the objects
themselves, but in the economic values attached to the objects.</p>
<p>Now we will take a particular instance of wealth and show how this
works out in practice and what various forms the production of wealth
takes.</p>
<p>Wealth, as we have seen, arises from the transposing of things around
us from a condition where they are less to a condition where they are
more useful to our needs.</p>
<p>Let us take a ton of coal lying a thousand feet down under the earth
and no way provided of getting at it. A man possessing that ton of coal
would not possess any wealth. The coal lying in the earth has no
economic value attaching to it whatsoever. It has not yet entered the
process whereby it ultimately satisfies a human need.</p>
<p>A shaft is sunk to get at that coal, and once the coal is reached a
first economic value begins to attach to it. Next, further labour,
capital and natural forces are applied to the task of hewing the coal
out and raising it to the surface. This means that yet more economic
values are attached to the ton of coal. These we express by saying that
the ton of coal at the bottom of the mine, just hewed out, is worth so
much—say 15/-; and later at the pit head is worth so much more—say £1.
But the process of production of wealth is not yet completed. The coal
is needed to warm you in your house, and your house is a long way from
the pit head. It must be taken from the pit head to your house, and for
this transport further labour, natural forces and capital must be used,
and these add yet another economic value to the coal.</p>
<p>We express this by saying that the ton of coal <em>delivered</em>
(that is, at your house) is worth not £1, which it was at the pit head,
but £1 10s.; and in this example we see that transport is as much a part
of the production of wealth as other work. We also see a further example
of the truth originally stated that wealth does not consist in the
object itself but in the values attached to it. The ton of coal is there
in your cellar exactly the same (except that it is broken up) as it was
when it lay a thousand feet under the earth with no way of getting to
it. In your cellar it represents wealth. In possessing it you are
possessing wealth to the amount of 30s. You could exchange it against
30s. worth of some other thing, such as wheat. But the wealth you thus
possess is not the actual coal, but the values attaching to the coal.
These economic values are being piled up from the very beginning of the
process of production until the process of consumption begins.</p>
<p>Here is another case which shows how the process of production will
add values to a thing without necessarily changing the thing itself.</p>
<p>Suppose an island where there is a lot of salt in mines near the
surface, but with very poor pasture and very little of it; most of the
soil barren and the climate bad. On the main-land, a day’s journey from
the island, there is good soil and pasture and a good climate, but there
is no salt. Salt is a prime necessity of life, and it comes into a lot
of things besides necessaries. To the people of the main land,
therefore, salt, which they lack, is of high value. To the people of the
island it is of low value, for they can get as much of it as they want,
with very little trouble. Meanwhile, meat is of very high value to the
people of the island, who can grow little of it on their own soil, while
it is of much less value to the people of the main-land, who have plenty
of it through their good pastures and climate. Here we have, let us say,
100 tons of salt in the island and 100 tons of meat on the main-land. A
boat takes the 100 tons of salt from the island to the main-land and
brings back the meat from the main-land to the island. Here wealth has
been created on both sides, although no change has taken place in the
articles themselves except a change in position. Both parties, the
islanders and the main-land people, are wealthier through the
transaction, and this is a case where <em>exchange</em> is a direct
creator of wealth, and the transport effecting the exchange is a creator
of wealth.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, everything done to increase the usefulness of an
object right up to the moment when consumption begins is part of the
production of wealth. For instance, wealth is being produced from the
moment that wheat is sowed in the ground to the moment when the baked
loaf is ready for eating, and the wealth expressed by the loaf, that is,
the values attaching to it, are made up by all the processes of adding
values from the first moment the seed was sown. When you eat a sixpenny
loaf you are beginning to consume values created by the sowing of the
wheat and its culture and its harvesting and grinding, and the working
of the flour into dough, and the baking, and created by every piece of
transport in the process, the carting of the sheaf into the rick, the
carting thrashed wheat to the mill, the taking of the flour to the
baker, the taking of the baked loaf to your house, and even the bringing
of the loaf from the larder to your table. Every one of these actions is
part of the production of wealth.</p>
<p>There is attaching to the process of the production of wealth a
certain character which we appreciate easily in some cases, but with
much more difficulty in others. We have already come across it in
discussing Capital. It is this:</p>
<p><em>All wealth is consumed.</em></p>
<p>This is universally true of all wealth whatsoever, though the rate of
consumption is very different in different cases.</p>
<p>The purpose of nature is not the purpose of man. Man only creates
wealth by a perpetual effort against the purpose of nature, and the
moment his effort ceases nature tends to drag back man’s creation from a
condition where it is more to a condition where it is less useful to
himself.</p>
<p>For some sorts of wealth the process is very rapid, as, for instance,
in the consumption of fuel, or in the wasting of ice on a hot day. Man
with an expenditure of his energy and brains applied to natural forces,
and by the use of capital, has caused ice to be present under conditions
where nature meant there to be no ice—a hot summer’s day.</p>
<p>He’has brought it from a high, cold place far away; or he has kept it
from the winter onwards stored in an ice house which he had to make and
to which he had to transport it; or he has made it with engine power.
But the force of nature is always ready to melt the ice when man’s
effort ceases.</p>
<p>The moment man’s effort ceases, deterioration, that is, <em>the
consumption of the wealth present,</em> at once begins. And this truth
applies at the other end of the scale. You may make a building of
granite, but it will not last for ever. The consumption is exceedingly
slow, but it is there all the same. And whether the consumption takes
place in the service of man (as when fuel is burnt on a hearth) or by
neglect (as when a derelict house decays) it is always <em>economic
consumption.</em></p>
<p>We may sum up in the following Formulae:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Transport and Exchange, quite as much as actual work on
the original material, form part of the Production of
Wealth.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>All Wealth is ultimately consumed: that is, matter having
been transposed by man from a condition where it is less to a condition
where it is more useful to himself, is dragged back from a condition
where it is more to a condition where It is less useful to
himself.</strong></p></li>

<section id="the-three-parts-into-which-the-wealth-produced-naturally-divides-itselfrent-interest-subsistence" class="level2">
<h2>The Three Parts Into Which the Wealth Produced Naturally Divides
Itself—Rent, Interest, Subsistence</h2>
<p>We now come to that part of Economics which has most effect upon
human society, and the understanding of which is most essential to sound
politics. It is not a difficult point to understand. The only difficulty
is to keep in our minds a clear distinction between what is called
economic law, that is, the necessary results of producing wealth, and
the moral law, that is the matter of right and wrong in the distribution
and use of wealth.</p>
<p>Some people are so shocked by the fact that economic law is different
from moral law that they try to deny economic law. Others are so annoyed
by this lack of logic that they fall into the other error of thinking
that economic law can override moral law.</p>
<p>You have to be warned against both these errors before you begin to
approach the subject of Rent, Profit and Subsistence. Only when we have
worked out the principles of these three things can we come back again
to the apparent clash between economic law and moral law, the
understanding of which is so very important in England to-day.</p>
<p>The motive of production is to satisfy human needs, and the simplest
case of production is that of a man working for himself and his family
as a settler in a new country. He cuts down wood and brings it where it
is wanted; he builds a hut and a bridge with it; he stacks it ready to
burn for fuel. The wealth he thus produces by his labour goes to him and
his, and because the labour he has to expend is what impresses him most
about the process, he calls the wealth produced at the end of it: ”
Wealth produced by his labour.” He thinks of his labour as the one agent
of the whole affair, and so it is the one immediate human agent; but, as
we have seen, there are two other agents as well. His mere labour (that
is, the use of his brain and his muscles) would not have produced a
pennyworth of wealth, but for two other agents: Natural Forces (or Land)
and Capital. And we shall find when we look into it that the wealth he
thus produces and regards as one thing is also really divided into three
divisions: one corresponding to each of the three agents which produce
wealth.</p>
<p>Being a settler living by himself and possessing his own land and his
own implements, he controls all he produces and does not notice the
three divisions. But three divisions there are none the less present in
all wealth produced anywhere, <strong>and these three divisions do not
correspond to the moral claim man has to the result of his
labour.</strong> They are divisions produced by the working of economic
law, which is as blind and indifferent to right and wrong as are the
ordinary forces of nature about us.</p>
<p>These three divisions are called <strong>RENT, INTEREST</strong> (or
<strong>Profit</strong>) and <strong>SUBSISTENCE.</strong> In order to
see how these three divisions come about we must take them in the order
of <em>Subsistence</em> first, then <em>Interest</em>, then
<em>Rent</em>.</p>
<section id="subsistence" class="level3">
<h3>1. Subsistence</h3>
<p>In any civilisation you will find a certain amount of things which
are regarded as necessaries. In any civilisation it is thought that
human beings must not be allowed to sink below a certain level, and a
certain amount of clothes of a certain pattern, a certain amount of
housing room and fuel, and a certain amount of food of a certain kind
are thought the very least upon which life can be conducted. Even the
poorest are not allowed to fall below that standard. This does not mean
that no one is allowed to starve or die of insufficient warmth. It means
that any particular civilisation (our own, for instance, or the Chinese)
has its regulation minimum and lets men die rather than fall below it.
This “certain amount,” below which even the poorest people’s livelihood
is not allowed to fall, is called <strong>THE STANDARD OF
SUBSISTENCE.</strong></p>
<p>Most people when they first think of these things imagine that there
is some very small amount of necessaries which, all over the world, and
at all times, would be thought absolutely essential to man. But it is
not so. The standard set is always higher than the mere necessity of
keeping alive would demand.</p>
<p>For instance, we in this country put into our standard of necessity
clothes of a rather complicated pattern. We should not tolerate the
poorest people going about in blankets. They must have boots on their
feet, which take a lot of labour and material. We should not tolerate
the poorest people going about barefooted, as they do in many other
countries, nor even with sandals. It is not our custom. They may die of
wet feet through bad leather boots and bad, thin clothing of our
complicated pattern, but they must not wear wooden shoes or walk
barefoot or go about in blankets.</p>
<p>Again, we do not live on anything at random, but upon cooked meat and
a certain special kind of grain called wheat. There are some grains much
cheaper than wheat; but our custom demands wheat even for the poorest,
if there is not enough wheat there is a famine, and famine is preferred
by society to the giving up of the wheat standard. Again, we insist upon
even the poorest having a certain amount of protection against the
weather in the way of houses, which must be up to a certain standard. We
do not tolerate their living in holes in the ground or mud huts.</p>
<p>One way and another we have set up a certain standard of subsistence
even for the poorest; <em>and every community in history has, at all
times, lived under this idea of a</em> <strong>minimum standard of
subsistence.</strong> This is so true that people will suffer great
inconvenience, even to famine, as I have said, rather than give up the
standard of subsistence. When people are too poor to afford this least
amount of what we think necessaries effort is made to supply them by
doles or a poor rate, or something of that kind; but the standard is not
abandoned.</p>
<p>Well, this <em>Minimum Standard of Subsistence</em> is the first
division in the Wealth produced. The prosperous man, tilling his own
land and possessed of his own capital, consumes, of course, much more
than the bare standard of subsistence would allow. He eats more food and
better food, and has more and better clothes and house room and fuel and
the rest than the mere standard of subsistence of his civilisation
demands. Nevertheless, even in his case the standard of subsistence is
there. It is a minimum below which, if things went wrong, he would not
fall. Ask him to fall below it and he would simply fail to do so. He
would try to produce that minimum amount of wealth in some other way, or
if he could not do that he would die.</p>
<p>This “Standard of Subsistence,” which is to be found in its various
shapes in every civilisation, may be called “<em>The Worth While of
Labour.</em>” Human energy would not be forthcoming, the work would not
get done, unless at the very least the person doing the work got this
Standard of Subsistence. In England to-day it is set for a man and his
family at something like 35s. to 40s. a week. One way and another,
counting for allowance in rent and overtime and so on, even the poorest
labourer gets that, and if he did not get it labour would stop. Our
civilisation would run to famine and plague rather than go below this
minimum.</p>
<p>Another way of putting it is this: Under the standard of subsistence
in our civilisation in England a man must, on the average, produce
something like £2 worth of economic values a week, otherwise it is not
worth while living, not worth while going on.</p>
<p>I say “on the average.” A great many people, of course, produce
nothing. But there must be an average production of that amount to keep
society going at all, merely in labour, that is, in human energy and
brains. As a fact, of course, the average production is much higher. But
it could not fall to less than this without the production of wealth
gradually coming to an end.</p>
<p>It is very important to recognise this principle in Economics, for it
is nearly always misunderstood, and it makes a great difference in our
judgment of social problems. You often hear people speaking as though
the subsistence of their fellows might fall to any level so long as they
had so much weight of food and amount of warmth as would keep them
alive. But it is not so. Every society has its own standard, and will
rather have men emigrate or die than fall below it: and that standard is
the basis of all production. <em>It must be satisfied or production
ceases.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="interest" class="level3">
<h3>2. Interest</h3>
<p>Now, if this “Worth While of Labour” was all that had to be
considered, things would be a great deal simpler than they are.
Unfortunately, there is another “worth while” from which one cannot get
away, and which makes the second division in the produce of wealth. This
is the “Worth While of Capital”: called “Profit” or “Interest.”</p>
<p>We must be careful not to mix up “Interest on Money,” that is, the
word “interest” in its ordinary conversational use, with true economic
interest. Interest on money does not really exist. It is either interest
on <em>Real Capital</em> (machines, stores, etc.) for which the money is
only a symbol, or else it is usury, that is, the claiming of a profit
which is not really there; and what usury is exactly we shall see later
on. The thing to remember here is that there is no such thing in
Economic Science as Interest on Money.</p>
<p>We have seen that Capital cannot come into existence unless somebody
saves. We have also seen that since it is always being consumed and must
be replaced, the saving has got to go on all the time, if the production
of wealth (to which capital is necessary) is to continue.</p>
<p>Now, as you will see in a minute, capital cannot be accumulated
without some motive. You only accumulate capital by doing without a
pleasure which you might have at a certain moment, and putting it off to
a future time. You go without the immediate enjoyment of your wealth in
order to use it for producing further wealth. That means restraint and
sacrifice.</p>
<p>But restraint and sacrifice require some motive. Why should a man, or
a society, do without a present enjoyment if the sacrifice is not to be
productive of future good?</p>
<p>What happens is this: A man says: “On my present capital I can
produce so much wealth. If I accumulate more capital I shall, in the
long run, have a larger income. I will therefore forgo my present
pleasure. I will add to my capital and have more income in the future
through my present self-restraint.” Or again: “If I don’t <em>keep
up</em> my capital by continual saving to replace what is consumed in
production I shall gradually get <em>less</em> income.”</p>
<p>But here comes in a very important law of Economics called “<em>The
Law of Diminishing Returns.</em>” After a certain point, capital as it
accumulates, does not produce a <em>corresponding</em> amount of extra
wealth. It produces some more, but not as much in proportion. For
instance, if you till a field thoroughly with the use of so many ploughs
and horses and so on, you will get such and such a return. If you add a
great deal more capital in the shape of food for more labourers and more
tillage till you treat the land as a sort of garden, you produce more
wealth from that field; but though you may have doubled your capital you
will not have doubled your income. You will only have added to it, say,
half as much again. If you were to double your capital again, making
four times your original amount, using a lot more food for labourers and
a lot more implements, you would again have a larger produce, probably,
but perhaps only double your original amount: <em>Four</em> times the
original amount of capital, and only <em>twice,</em> say, the old
income.</p>
<p>So the process goes on; and in all forms of the production of wealth
this formula applies, and is true: “<em>The returns of increasing
capital, so long as the method of production is not changed, get greater
in amount, but less in proportion to the total capital
employed.</em>”</p>
<p>Men developing a certain section of natural forces get 10% on a small
capital, perhaps 5%, on a larger one; on a still larger one only 2½%,
and so on, if they apply that capital to the <em>same section</em> of
natural forces and in the <em>same manner.</em></p>
<p>Well, this advantage which a man gets by adding to his capital at the
expense of present enjoyment can be measured.</p>
<p>For instance, a man owning a farm and tilling it himself gets a
harvest of 1,000 sacks of wheat. In order to get this result he must
have capital at the beginning of every year—ploughs and horses, and
sacks of grain and what not—worth altogether 10,000 sacks of wheat. His
income, in wheat, is one-tenth of his capital. Every ten sacks of
capital produces him an income of one sack a year. He says to himself:
“If I were to plough the land more thoroughly and put on a lot more
phosphates and slag and get new, improved machinery I might get another
fifty sacks a year out of the land, but this new capital will have to be
saved.”</p>
<p>He carefully saves on every harvest, exchanging the wheat for the
things he needs in the way of new capital, until, after a few years, the
implements and the phosphates and slag and the rest on his land, and all
his other capital is worth much more than it used to be.</p>
<p>Instead of being worth only <em>one</em> thousand sacks, his capital
is now worth <em>two</em> thousand sacks, and he gets the reward for his
putting by and doing without immediate enjoyment in the shape of a
larger harvest. But though he has doubled his capital he has not doubled
his income. Instead of the old income of 100 sacks of wheat he is now
getting 150 sacks of wheat. Thus though his income is larger, the
proportion of that income to the total capital is less. For 1,000 sacks
of capital he got 100 sacks of wheat at harvest; but now for 2,000 sacks
of capital he only gets 150 sacks at the harvest. Or (as we put it in
modern language), his income is no longer 10% on his capital, but 7½ %
only. He has a larger income, but it is smaller in proportion to the
capital invested.</p>
<p>Now, although the 2,000 of capital invested is thus bringing him in a
smaller <em>proportion</em> of income than the old 1,000 did, he thinks
it worth while: because he is at any rate getting more <em>income;</em>
150 sacks instead of only 100. But there must come a time when he will
no longer think it worth while to go on saving. Supposing he finds, for
instance, that after taking all the trouble to accumulate and apply to
his land capital to the value of 10,000 sacks of wheat, he gets only 200
sacks, that is 2% annual reward for all this saving, he will not think
it good enough, and he will stop saving. The point where he stops, the
return below which he does not think it worth while to save, marks the
<em>minimum profits of capital.</em> A man is delighted, of course, to
have <em>more</em> profit than this if he can. But the point is, he will
not take <em>less.</em> Rather than make less than a certain proportion
of income to his capital he will stop saving, and spend all he has in
immediate enjoyment.</p>
<p>It is this obvious truth which makes the second great division in the
produce of wealth. You must, as we have seen, produce enough to keep
labour going. That is, you must produce enough to satisfy the standard
of subsistence in your society; <em>but you must also produce enough
more to keep capital accumulating.</em> You must produce, over and above
subsistence, whatever happens to be the amount of <em>profits</em> for
which capital will accumulate in any particular society (with us,
to-day, it is about 5%).</p>
<p>It is very important to observe that this second division, Profit, or
Interest, must always be present, no matter how the capital is owned and
controlled, no matter who gets the profit.</p>
<p>Some people have thought that if you were to take capital away from
the rich men who now own most of it and to give it to the politicians to
manage for everybody, this division, Profit, would disappear. But it is
not so. The people who were managing the capital for the benefit of
everybody would have to tell the electors that they could not have all
the wealth produced to consume as they chose: a certain amount would
have to be kept back, and people would only consent to have a certain
amount kept back on condition that they got an advantage in the future
as a reward of their immediate sacrifice. Even if you had a Despot at
the head of the State who cared nothing for people’s opinions, this
division of profit would still be there; for it would be mere waste to
accumulate capital at a heavy sacrifice to himself and his subjects,
unless it produced a future reward.</p>
<p>If the Despot said, “This year you must do without <em>half</em> your
usual amount of leisure and without <em>half</em> your usual amounts,
pay <em>double</em> for your cinemas and for your beer, and all that in
order to earn one hundredth more leisure and amusements next year,” it
would be found intolerable.</p>
<p>So it comes to this: There are always present in the process of
production two agents, Capital and Labour, and each of these must have
in one form or another its “Worth While,” otherwise it wont go on. You
must satisfy the “Worth While of Labour” and you must satisfy the “Worth
While of Capital.” If you do not, labour stops working and capital stops
accumulating, and the whole business of production breaks down.</p>
<p>(Of course, we must be careful to distinguish between the case of a
private man increasing his investments and the general increase of
capital as applied to an unchanging area of natural forces. John Smith
having £1 ,000 invested at 5% can save another £1,000 and another and
many more, and still get 5%. But that is because he is saving and makes
up for others wasting, or because his saving is so small a proportion of
the total Capital of Society that it has no appreciable effect. But if
the total Capital of Society be thus increased the Law of Diminishing
Returns eventually comes into play.)</p>
</section>
<section id="rent" class="level3">
<h3>3. Rent</h3>
<p>We arrive through this at the third division, <em>Rent.</em></p>
<p>Under some circumstances the “Worth While of Labour” and the “Worth
While of Capital” can just barely be earned, and no more. Under those
circumstances production will take place, but under worse circumstances
it will not.</p>
<p>For instance, where there is very light, sandy soil near a heath a
man finds that by putting a thousand pounds of capital on to a hundred
acres of land he can get his bare subsistence and £50 worth of produce
over: 5%, on his capital. It is worth his while to cultivate that land,
just barely worth his while. He also possesses land on a still more
sandy part over the boundary of the heath itself. He calculates that if
he were laboriously to save another £1,000 and take in 100 acres of the
new, worse land, he would make the bare subsistence of the labour
employed upon it, but only £10 extra, that is, only 1% on his new
capital. He would say: “This is not worth while,” and the too-sandy bit
of land would go uncultivated.</p>
<p>When the conditions are such that the capital and labour applied to
them <em>just</em> get their worth while and no more, those conditions
are said to be “<em>on the margin of production,</em>” which means that
they are the worst conditions under which men in a particular society
will consent to produce wealth at all. Put them on conditions still
worse, and they will not produce.</p>
<p>Now the existence of this Margin of Production creates the third
division in Wealth, which is called <strong>RENT.</strong></p>
<p><em>Rent is the surplus over and above the minimum required by labour
and capital out of the total produce.</em> (We must be careful, as we
saw in the case of “Interest” not to confuse true economic Rent with
“Rent” in the conversational sense. Thus what is called “the rent” of a
house is part of it true economic rent, but part of it interest on the
accumulated or saved wealth, the <em>Capital</em> of its bricks and
mortar and building.)</p>
<p>Take the case of a seam of coal, which at one end of its run crops
out on the surface, a couple of miles on is only 1,000 feet below the
surface, but dips down gradually until, within twenty miles, it is
10,000 feet below the surface.</p>
<p>Under the conditions of the society in which the coal is being mined,
and in the state which the science of mining has reached, it is found
that, at a depth of 5,000 feet, this seam is <em>just</em> worth while
mining: that is, the capital which has to be accumulated for sinking the
shafts and bringing the miners up and down from their work, and raising
the coal to the surface, and providing subsistence for the miners at
their work, <em>just barely</em> gets the profit below which it would
not be worth while to use it.</p>
<p>A shaft sunk at this depth, for instance, and the machinery and
stores cost £10,000, and when you get the coal to the surface that coal
will pay the standard of subsistence of the labourers and leave £500
profit for capital; that is, 5%. Capital will not accumulate if it gets
less than 5%. Labour will not be exercised if it gets less than its
standard subsistence; therefore, the coal which lies farther along the
seam, deeper than 5,000 feet, will be left untouched. It is not “worth
while” to sink a shaft to try and get it. It is “below the Margin of
Production.”</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/MarginOfProduction.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens to the coal in the places where it gets nearer and
nearer to the surface? Obviously, it is better worth while to sink
shafts there than it is at 5,000 feet. You only want the same amount of
labour for cutting the coal out, whether it is 5,000 feet below the
surface or 2,000, and you want much less capital and labour in sinking
the shafts and bringing the coal to the surface and getting the miners
up and down. There is, therefore, a surplus. Thus with a shaft only
2,000 feet deep you need, say, only £5,000 worth of capital to get £500
worth of coal over and above the subsistence of the labourers. 5% on
£5,000 is £250—so in that case there is a benefit of an extra £250
<em>after</em> the “worth while” of Capital and Labour are satisfied.
Over and above what is just the “worth while” of capital and labour for
getting the coal you have in the shallower mines extra value, and that
extra value gets larger and larger as the distance of the coal from the
surface gets less and less. The deepest mine is on what we call “the
margin of production.” It is just worth while to work it. The surplus
values in all the shallower mines are called RENT. If a landlord owned
the coal in quite a shallow part where it was within a thousand feet of
the surface, he could say to the labourers and the owners of capital who
were coming to dig it out: “The mine which is working at 5,000 feet is
just worth your while. If you work here at 1,000 feet you will have a
great deal more than 5% on your capital, and the subsistence of labour
is just the same. All this extra amount of values, however, I must have,
otherwise you shall not work my coal.”</p>
<p>Since the Capitalists are content to accumulate capital for a return
of 5% and the labourers to work for their subsistence, the extra amount
is paid to the landlord. If one set of people refuse to pay it, there
will always be another set of people who will be content to pay it and
this extra amount or surplus is called “Economic <em>Rent,</em>” which
is something, of course, much more strictly defined than, and different
from, what we call Rent in ordinary conversation.</p>
<p>Or again, take three farms of equal area but varying fertility. Each
requires £1,000 capital to stock it and five labourers to work it. The
£1,000 capital demands £50 a year profit. The five labourers need £500
in a year to meet their standard of subsistence. The poorest farm raises
just £550 worth of produce a year. The next best raises £750, and the
best one £950 worth. Then there is no economic rent on the first; it
lies on the “margin of production.” There is £200 economic rent a year
on the second, and £400 on the third.</p>
<p>We can sum the whole thing up and say that on the mass of all
production there are three charges:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>First, the charge for the subsistence of
labour.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next, the charge of profits, or interest, for the reward
of capital, that is, of saving, and lastly</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>In varying amounts, rising from nothing at the margin of
production, to larger and larger amounts under more favourable
circumstances, the surplus value called Economic Rent.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three divisions are always present whenever wealth is produced.
The same man may get all three at once, as happens when a farmer works
good land which is his own. Or again, when one man owns the fertile land
and another man provides the capital, and yet another man provides the
labour, the three divisions appear as three incomes of Labourer, Farmer
and Landlord receiving separately Wages, Profit and Rent. Whether these
divisions appear openly, paid to different classes of men, or whether
they are concealed by all coming into the same hands, they are present
everywhere and always. That is a fixed economic law from which there is
no getting away.</p>
<p>Always remember that these economic laws are in no way binding in a
social sense. They are not laws like moral laws, which men are bound to
obey. They are certain mathematical consequences of the very nature of
wealth and its production, which men must take into account when they
make their social arrangements. It does not follow because Rent or
Interest are present that such and such rich men, or the State, or the
labourers, have a right to them. That is for the moralist to decide; and
men can in such matters make what arrangements they will. All economic
science can tell us is how to distinguish between the three divisions,
and to remember that they are inevitable and necessary. But we must wait
until a little later on to discuss social rights and wrongs under
Applied Economics and continue here for the present to confine ourselves
to the Elements of economic law alone.</p>

<section id="exchange" class="level2">
<h2>Exchange</h2>
<p><strong>Exchange</strong> is really only a form of production, as we
saw in the illustration of the island with salt and the main-land with
meat. When the exchange of the things is of advantage to both parties it
creates wealth for both, and profitable exchange is, therefore, when it
takes place, only the last step in a general chain of production.</p>
<p>But Exchange is so separate an action that students of Economics have
agreed to treat it as a sort of chapter by itself, and we will do so
here.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Exchange is that you take a thing from a place
where it has less value to a place where it has more value, thus adding
an economic value to the thing moved and so creating wealth. In the same
transaction you bring back something else against it, which has more
value in your own place than it had in the place from which you took it,
that is again adding an economic value and therefore creating wealth. We
saw how this was in the case of the salt and the meat, and so it is with
thousands upon thousands of exchanges going on all over the world.</p>
<p>For instance, we in England have grown fond of drinking tea in the
last 200 years. But our climate will not allow us to grow tea. Tea can
only grow in a very hot country.</p>
<p>Now in very hot countries specially heavy labour upon metal work is
not to be expected. Men are not fit for it. But in this cool climate men
are fit for it, and also men here have through long practice become very
skilful at working metal: smelting iron, for instance, and making it up
into machines.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a double advantage to us and to the people who
live in the hot countries where tea is grown if we <em>exchange.</em> We
send them metal things that we have made and which are useful to them,
and which they could hardly make themselves, or only with very great
difficulty (and, therefore, at a great expense of energy), and we get
from them tea, which we could not grow here except in hot houses: that
is, at much more expense of energy than is needed in the countries where
tea grows naturally out of doors.</p>
<p>W’hen there are present two or more objects of this kind, such that
the exchange of them between two places will benefit both parties, we
may speak of “<em>a potential of exchange,</em>” stronger or weaker
according to the amount of mutual advantage derived.</p>
<p>This word “potential” you will not find yet in many books, but it is
coming in, for it is a very useful word. It is taken by way of metaphor
from Physical Science. When there is a head of water over a dam, or a
current of electricity of such and such an intensity, we talk of the
“<em>potential</em>” and measure it. For instance, we say this
electrical current is double the potential of that, or the head of water
working such and such turbines is at double the potential of another
head of water in the neighbourhood. In the same way we talk of a
“potential” of exchange, meaning a tendency for exchange to arise
between two places or people because it is of mutual benefit to
both.</p>
<p>Potentials of exchange come into existence not only through
difference of climate or differences of habit, but also through what is
called the <em>Differentiation of Employment,</em> which is also called
Division of Labour.</p>
<p>Thus two countries may be both equally able to produce, say, metal
work and silk fabrics, and yet if one of them concentrates on getting
better and better at metal work and the other on getting better and
better at silk fabrics, it may well be that both will benefit by
separating their jobs and exchanging the results. And this is true not
only of two countries, but of individuals and groups.</p>
<p>The cobbler does not make his own clothes. He makes boots, and by
learning his trade and getting used to it makes them much better and in
a much shorter time than other men could, and therefore makes a pair of
boots with less expense of energy, that is, <em>cheaper,</em> than
another man would. The tailor can say the same thing about making
clothes. So it is to the advantage of the cobbler to exchange his extra
boots against the extra clothes the tailor has made.</p>
<p>In general: intelligent societies always tend to build up a very
wide-spread system of exchange, because intelligent people tend to
concentrate each on the job that suits him best, and also because
intelligent people discover differences of climate and soil and the rest
which may make exchange between two places a mutual advantage for
both.</p>
<p>It is indeed a great mistake to do as some modern people do, and put
Exchange in front of Production. Thus you hear people talking as though
the trade a country does, the total amount of its exports and imports,
were the test of its prosperity, whereas the real test of its prosperity
is what it has the power to consume, not what it manages to
exchange.</p>
<p>But still, though it comes at the end of Production and must never be
made more important than the whole process of Production, Exchange is
present universally wherever there is active production of Wealth. Thus
the group of people who build ships are really exchanging what they make
against the produce of other people who make clothes and grow food and
build houses, and the rest of it; and in a highly-civilised country like
ours much the greater part of the wealth you see consumed around you has
gone through many processes of exchange.</p>
<p>There are a few elementary Formulae concerning Exchange which it is
important to remember.</p>
<p>1. <strong>There is a Potential of Exchange, that is, exchange tends
to take place, when of two objects the proportionate values are
different in two different communities.</strong></p>
<p>It is not very easy to understand the meaning of this until one is
given an example. Supposing a ton of coal from England to be worth £2 by
the time it is delivered in Cadiz, and supposing that making a dozen
bottles of wine in England, with all the apparatus of hot-house grapes
and the rest of it, came to £5 of expense. Supposing that in Cadiz, from
the small coal mines near by, they can produce coal at only £1 a ton,
but on account of their climate they can produce a dozen of wine for a
shilling. Then you get this curious situation:</p>
<p>It pays the exporting country, England, to sell coal in Cadiz <em>at
less than its English economic value,</em> and to import the wine from
Cadiz. It pays your English owner of coal, although the values attaching
to it by the time it has got to Cadiz are £2 a ton, to sell a ton of
coal there for only £1, and to exchange that against the wine of Cadiz,
and bring that back to England. At first sight it sounds absurd to say
that selling thus at a lower value than the cost of production and
transport can possibly be profitable.</p>
<p>But if you will look at it closely you will see that it is so.</p>
<p>If the Englishman had tried to make his wine at home it would have
cost him £100 to make twenty dozen bottles, but when he has sold his
coal at Cadiz for £1 he can with that £1 buy twenty dozen of wine and
bring it back to England. He is much the wealthier by the transaction,
and so is the man at Cadiz. The Cadiz man could have spent his energies
in digging out a ton of coal near Cadiz instead of importing it, but the
same energies used in making wine produce enough wine to get him rather
more coal from England.</p>
<p>2. The second Formula to remember about Exchange is this:
<strong>Goods do not directly exchange always one against the other, but
usually in a much more complicated way, by what may be called</strong>
<em>Multiple Exchange.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the vehicle by which this is done is a currency, or
<em>money,</em> which I will explain in a moment; but the point to seize
here is that exchange is just as truly taking place when there is no
direct barter of two things but a much longer and complicated
process.</p>
<p>For instance, a group of people called a Railway Company in the
Argentine want a locomotive. A locomotive can be produced cheaper and
better, that is, with less expenditure of energy for the result, in
England than in the Argentine. But on the other hand, England wants to
import tea. Now the Argentine grows no tea. What happens? How does
England get the tea? That locomotive goes out to the Argentine. An
amount of wheat sufficient to exchange against the locomotive goes
against it, not to England, but to Holland, a country which, like us,
has to import a lot of wheat. As against the wheat sent to Holland, the
people in Holland send, say, the cheeses which they make so well, on
account of their special conditions, and the consignment goes to
Germany. The Germans send out a number of rails equivalent to the number
of cheeses and of the wheat and of the locomotive, as they are very good
at making rails, and have specialised on it. But they do not send the
rails to Holland. They send them to some Railway Company which has asked
for them in Egypt. The Egyptian people send out an equivalent amount of
cotton, which they can grow easily in their climate, and this cotton
goes to mills in India, and against it there comes an equivalent amount
of tea, but the tea does not go back to Egypt. It goes to England.</p>
<p>There you have a circle of Multiple Exchange in which everybody
profits by the exchange going on, although it is indirect. In the same
way, of course, it is true that all of our domestic exchanges at home
are multiple. If I write a book which people want to read, whereas I
want not books but several other things, boots and fuel and furniture, I
do not take my books round to the man who provides boots and to the one
who provides fuel and to the one who provides furniture, I go through
the process of selling my book to a publisher, and through an instrument
he gives me, called a cheque (I will explain this when we come to the
point of money), I can obtain boots and fuel and furniture to the amount
of the value of the books of mine which my publisher will sell. Yet when
exchange is thus highly indirect and multiple it is just as much
exchange as though I went and bartered one book for one pair of boots
with the cobbler.</p>
<p>3. The third thing to remember about Exchange is of the utmost
importance, because it has given rise to one of the biggest discussions
of our English politics. The Formula runs thus:—</p>
<p><strong>Other things being equal, the greatest freedom of exchange in
any given area makes for the greatest amount of wealth in that
area.</strong></p>
<p>It ought to be self evident, but it is astonishing how muddled people
get about it, when they become confused over details and cannot see the
wood for the trees. It ought, I say, to be self-evident that if you
leave Exchange quite free, anybody being at liberty to produce what he
can produce best, and exchange it for things which other men can produce
better than he, both parties will tend to be the richer by such freedom
and the wealth of the whole country will be greatest when all exchanges
in it are thus left free to be worked by the sense of advantage.</p>
<p>If there were a law, for instance, preventing me from buying
etchings, or preventing Jones, the etcher, from buying books, Jones
would have to write his own books (or do without them, which is what he
would do), and I should have to etch my own etchings, which would be
exceedingly poor compared with the wonderful etchings of Jones. We are
obviously both of us better off if we are left free to exchange what we
can each make best. And so it is with all the countless things made in a
State.</p>
<p>This principle applies not only to a particular nation but to the
whole world. If you left the whole world free to exchange the whole
world would be the richer for it. And any interference with exchange
between one nation and another lessens the total possible amount of
wealth there might be in the world.</p>
<p>So far so good; and, as I have said, such a truth ought to be
self-evident. But here there comes in a misunderstanding of its
application, and that misunderstanding has made any amount of trouble.
It is so important that I must give it a separate division to
itself.</p>
</section>
<section id="free-trade-and-production" class="level2">
<h2>Free Trade and Production</h2>
<p>Nations, as we know, put up tariffs against goods which come from
abroad: That is, their Governments tax imports of certain goods and
thereby interfere with the freedom of exchange. For instance, the French
have a tax of this kind upon wheat. Wheat grown in France will cost, let
us say, £1 a sack, but the Argentine can send wheat to France at an
expense of only 10s. a sack, because the land there is new, and for
various other causes. If the wheat from the Argentine were allowed to
come in freely, and the French to export against it things which they
can make more easily than wheat they would have more wheat at a less
total expense; but they prefer to put a tax of ten shillings upon every
sack, that is, to put up a barrier against the import of wheat from
abroad, and so keep up the price artificially at home.</p>
<p>When a nation does this with regard to any object that may be
imported, if the object can also be produced within the nation (which it
nearly always can) it is said to <em>protect</em> that object, and the
system of so doing is called <strong>Protection.</strong> The word arose
from the demand of certain trades to be “protected” by their Governments
without considering whether it was for the good of the whole nation or
not. It obviously would be a very nice thing for people who breed sheep,
for instance, in this country, if all mutton coming from the Colonies
were taxed at the Ports, while the mutton grown inside the country were
not taxed; for in this way the value of the mutton would rise in
England, and the rise would benefit the sheep owners. But it would be at
the expense of all the other people who did not grow sheep, and who
would have to pay more for their mutton.</p>
<p>As opposed to this system of <em>Protection,</em> and interfering
with international exchange by a tariff, intelligent people a long
lifetime ago began to agitate for what they called <strong>“FREE
TRADE,”</strong> that is the putting of no tariff on to an import, or at
least no tariff high enough to give an artificial price to the producer
of the same thing at home. Thus, when England was completely Free
Trading (which it was until the war) there was a tariff on tea; but that
was not Protection, for those who would try to grow tea here would have
to grow it in hot houses and at an enormous expense, and the tax on tea,
though heavy, did not make it anything like so dear as to make it worth
while to produce tea here.</p>
<p>Another principle of Free Trade was that if it was thought advisable
to put a tariff on to anything coming into the country which could be
produced in the country, then you would have to put what was called
“<em>an equivalent excise</em>” on the thing produced at home. For
instance, in order to get revenue, one might put a tax of a 1d. on the
pound on sugar coming from Germany, but, according to the doctrine of
Free Trade, you must put a similar excise (that is, a home tax of 1d. on
the pound) upon any sugar produced in England. If you did not do that
you would be benefiting the sugar manufacturer in England at the expense
of all other Englishmen, which would be unjust and also make England
less wealthy because it would be inducing Englishmen to make sugar by
offering them a reward and so take them away from some production for
which they were better fitted.</p>
<p>This idea, that Free Trade must necessarily be of advantage to
everybody, and that it was only stupidity or private avarice which
supported Protection, was very strong in England, and, in the form you
have just read, it seems beyond contradiction.</p>
<p>But if you will look closely at Formula No. 3 written in the last
division on page 59 you will see that there is a fallacy hidden in this
universal Free Trade theory. It is perfectly true that free exchange
over any area tends to make the wealth of all that area greater, and if
the area include the whole world, then free exchange all over the whole
world, that is, complete Free Trade, would make the world as a whole
richer.</p>
<p><em>But it does not follow that</em> <strong>each part</strong>
<em>of the area thus made richer is itself enriched.</em> That is the
important point which the Free Trade people missed, and it is this which
supports, in some cases, the argument for Protection.</p>
<p>If we allow free exchange everywhere throughout England, England as a
whole will, of course, be the richer for it; but it is quite possible
that Essex will be the poorer. If we allow Free Trade throughout all
Europe, Europe will be the richer for it; but it is quite possible that
some particular part of Europe, Italy or Spain, may be made poorer by
the general process, and as they don’t want to be poorer they will by
Protection and tariffs cut themselves off from the area of free
exchange.</p>
<p><strong>There are conditions where an interference with free exchange
over the boundaries of a particular area make that area richer: when
those conditions exist, there is what is called an Economic Reason for
Protection.</strong></p>
<p>So we may sum up and say that the theory of universal Free Trade
being of benefit to the world as a whole is perfectly true. If we are
only considering the world, and do not mind what happens to some
particular area of the world, then the case for Free Trade is absolute.
But if we mind a hurt being done to some particular area, such as our
own country, more than we mind the hurt done to the world as a whole,
then we should look at our particular conditions and see whether our
country may not be one of those parts which will be drained of wealth by
Free Trade and will be benefited by artificially fostering internal
exchanges.</p>
<p>In the second part of this book I will go into this again, and show
how the discussion arose in England and what the arguments are for and
against Universal Free Trade, and how true it is that a sound economic
argument for Protection exists.</p>
</section>
<section id="money" class="level2">
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>When people begin exchanging by bartering goods one against another
they at once find that there is an awkward obstruction to this kind of
commerce; at least, they find it the moment there are more than two of
them. It is this: That the person they are nearest to for the striking
of a bargain may not want, at the moment, the particular thing they have
to offer, but something else which a third party has who is <em>not</em>
present.</p>
<p>For instance: John is a hunter who has a surplus of skins to offer.
He can get skins easier than other people. William, farming good soil,
has surplus wheat to offer, and Robert, living near a wood and skilled
as a woodman, has extra wood to offer. John wants wood. He takes one of
his furs to Robert and says: “I will give you this fur for a cartload of
wood.” But Robert may answer, “I don’t happen to want a fur just now.
What I do want is a sack of wheat.”</p>
<p>Either no transaction will take place on account of this hitch, or
one of these two things will happen: Robert will take the fur from John
and give him his cartload of wood, and will then take the fur over to
William, and see whether William wants a fur in exchange for some wheat.
Or John, very much wanting the wood, will go to William, and if William
wants a fur, will exchange it for wheat; then John will take the wheat
back to Robert, and exchange it for the wood that he wants.</p>
<p>That is the sort of complicated and clumsy come-and-go that will be
continually happening even with quite a few exchangers, and with quite a
small number of articles. When it came to a great number of exchangers
and a great number of articles the trouble would grow impossible and
exchange would break down.</p>
<p>But things arrange themselves thus: It is soon found that one of the
things which are being exchanged is easier to carry than the rest, and
perhaps lasts longer and also can be easily used in small or large
amounts. For instance, in the case of our three producers, John, William
and Robert, <em>wheat</em> might easily appear in this character. People
always want wheat sooner or later. It keeps well. It is not very
difficult to transport, and you can divide it into quite small amounts,
or lump it up in large amounts.</p>
<p>So the chances are that when any of the three wanted to benefit by
getting rid of some of his surplus produce he would get into the habit
of taking <em>wheat</em> in exchange, even if he did not want it for the
moment. For he would say to himself: “I can always keep it by me and
then exchange it against somebody else’s produce when that somebody else
happens to want wheat. Soon you would find each one of the three would
be keeping a little wheat by him for the purpose of saving tiresome
journeys to effect complicated double exchanges, and the wheat so used
by all three of them would be in effect <strong>MONEY.</strong> It would
be used as a common medium of exchange to facilitate the disposal of
goods one against the other, without the elaborate business of making
special barters, after long search.</p>
<p>Mankind has found, in most cases, that where a very large number of
articles were being exchanged <em>two</em> in particular naturally lent
themselves to this particular use, and those two were
<strong>gold</strong> and <strong>silver.</strong> They have also used
bronze, and even iron and in some places rare shells, and all sorts of
other things. But gold and silver came to be for nearly all mankind, and
are now for all civilised mankind, the objects which most naturally are
used as money.</p>
<p>The reason for this is as follows:</p>
<p>The thing which naturally becomes money out of all the things that
are exchanged will be that which best combines a certain number of
qualities, some of which we have already mentioned, and of which here is
a list.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It must be portable, that is, a large weight of it must take up
little room, so that quite considerable values can be taken easily from
place to place—for money has to be always moving from one to another to
effect purchases and sales.</p></li>
<li><p>It must be easily divisible, for one is always wanting to use it
in all sorts of amounts, very little and very large.</p></li>
<li><p>It must keep. That is, it must not deteriorate quickly, or it
would have very little use as Money.</p></li>
<li><p>It must be of an even quality, so that, wherever you come across
it, you may count on its being pretty well always the same, and
therefore weight for weight of the same value.</p></li>
<li><p>It must be more or less stable in value. It would be difficult to
use as money some object which was very plentiful at one moment and
suddenly scarce at another; very cheap this year, and very dear next
year—such as are, for instance, agricultural products depending upon the
season.</p></li>

<p>Now of all objects Gold and Silver best fulfil all these
requirements. Precious stones are more portable, value for value. A
£1,000 worth of diamonds takes up less space and is less heavy than a
£1,000 worth of gold. And precious stones are fairly stable in value and
also keep very well; but they are not easily divisible. Again, they are
not of the same standard value in all cases. They vary in purity. But
gold and silver have all the qualities required. Gold hardly decays at
all through the passage of time, and silver very little; and each, but
especially gold, is valuable for its bulk, and its value is fairly
stable, and each is easily divisible and can therefore be presented in
any amount, from a tenth of an ounce to a hundred pounds weight.</p>
<p>So, by the mere force of things. Gold and Silver became the Money of
mankind. People kept gold and silver by them in order to effect their
exchanges, and very soon a producer did not feel himself to be
exchanging at all (in the sense of exchanging goods against goods), but
thought of the affair as <em>Buying and Selling.</em> That is, of
exchanging his produce, not against other produce, but against gold and
silver, with the object of <em>later</em> re-exchanging that gold and
silver for other things that he needed.</p>
<p>Money, once thus established, is called <strong>A MEDIUM OF
EXCHANGE</strong> and also <strong>CURRENCY</strong> or <strong>THE
CIRCULATING MEDIUM.</strong> It is called “currency” and “circulating”
because it goes its round through society, effecting the exchanges, and
this running around or circulating gives it its name: “That which is
current” from the Latin for “running.” That which “circulates” from the
late Latin word for “going the rounds.”</p>
<p>When gold and silver become the money of mankind it is important to
be able to tell at once the exact amounts you are dealing with. This,
under simple conditions, is done by weighing; but it is more convenient
to stamp on separate bits of metal what weight there is in each, and
that is called “coining the metal.” All that a Government does when it
makes a sovereign is to guarantee that there is so much weight of gold
in the round disc of metal which it stamps.</p>
<p>Money does not only fill this main function of being a medium of
exchange, that is, of making a vast quantity of complicated exchanges
possible, it also has great social value as a measurer or standard, and
soon after money comes into use men begin to think of the economic
values of things in terms of money: that is, in what we call
<strong>“Prices.”</strong></p>
<p>All things which men produce are fluctuating the whole time in value.
There is now rather more of one article, and now rather less. A sack of
barley at one moment will exchange exactly against a sack of wheat, and
then in a few weeks against rather less than a sack of wheat. Meanwhile,
where it used to fetch a lamb in exchange it may, in a few months, need
two sacks for a lamb; and so with all the hundreds and thousands of
other objects. When we have money the whole mass of transactions is
referred to the current medium, and that is of immense social value. For
no one could keep in his head all the changing exchange values of a
multitude of articles one against the other, but it is easy to remember
the exchange values against one standard commodity, such as gold. And
whatever the exchange value is in gold we call the
<strong>price</strong> of the article.</p>
<p>For instance, when you say that a house is worth £500, that that is
the <em>“price”</em> of the house, you mean that the amount of gold you
would have to exchange to get it is about Ten Pounds weight of the
metal. And when you say that the price of a ticket to Edinburgh is £4,
you mean that the service of taking you to Edinburgh in the train will
be exchanged against about an ounce of the metal gold.</p>
<p>I now come to a most difficult point about money and prices which is
rather beyond the elements of Economics, but which it is important to
have some idea of, though it is very difficult.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting study in Economics called <em>“The Theory
of Prices,”</em> showing why <em>all prices on the average</em> (what is
called “General Prices,” that is the value of all goods <em>in
general</em> as measured against gold) sometimes begin to go up and at
other times go down: Why goods as a whole begin to get dearer and dearer
in gold money, or cheaper and cheaper. It is a complicated piece of
study, and people dispute about it. But the general rules would seem to
be something like this: The exchange value of things against gold, or
the value of gold, against the things for which it exchanges (that is
prices) is made up of two things: <em>First,</em> the amount of gold
present to do the work of exchange; <em>Secondly,</em> the amount of
work you can make it do in exchange: The pace at which you can get it to
circulate. It is obvious that one piece of gold moving rapidly from hand
to hand will do as much work in helping exchanges to be carried out as
ten pieces moving ten times more slowly.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, the total amount of gold becomes suddenly smaller
or suddenly larger, or if the pace at which it is used changes very
quickly, then prices fluctuate violently.</p>
<p>Supposing you could, in a night, take away half the gold in
circulation. Then, of course, the remaining gold would become much more
valuable. In other words, prices would fall. For if an ounce of gold is
rarer and more difficult to get than it was, it will exchange against,
that is, “buy” more than it did; this means that “the price of things
has fallen.” We used to say, for instance, that a quarter of wheat was
worth an ounce of gold. But if we suddenly change the amount of gold so
that gold becomes much rarer and more valuable, perhaps an ounce of gold
will buy not one quarter but two. The price of one quarter used to be an
ounce of gold. Now the price is only half an ounce of gold. Wheat has
become cheaper in proportion to gold, and “prices,” that is, values
measured in gold, in money, have fallen.</p>
<p>The same thing would happen if you did not lessen the amount of gold
in circulation but made the circulation much more sluggish. The amount
of gold in circulation would be the same, but as it went its rounds more
slowly it would be more difficult to get a certain amount of gold in any
one place at any one time.</p>
<p>Prices, then, depend upon the actual amount of money that is present
to do the work, <em>and</em> the pace at which it is made to go the
rounds: or (to put it in technical terms), on the amount of the currency
<em>and</em> its <em>“efficiency in circulation.”</em></p>
<p>Now, there is in the human mind a very strong tendency to keep prices
stable. We think of them by a sort of natural illusion as though they
were absolute fixed things. We think of a pound, and a shilling, and
five pounds as real, permanent, unchanging values. If we find that quite
suddenly five pounds will buy a great deal more than it used to, or
quite suddenly a great deal less, if we are met by a sudden and violent
fluctuation in prices of this kind, our minds tend, unconsciously, to
bring things back, as much as possible, to the old position; and I will
show you how this tendency works in practice.</p>
<p>Supposing a very great deal of gold, for some cause, were to
disappear. People suddenly find prices falling very rapidly. A man with
a £1,000 a year can buy twice as many things, perhaps, as he used to
buy. On the other hand, a man with anything to sell can only get half
the amount he used to get. For gold has become rarer, and therefore more
valuable as against other things.</p>
<p>What is the result? <em>The result is a very rapid increase in the
pace at which the gold circulates.</em> Every purchaser feels himself
richer. The gold is tendered for a much larger number of bargains, and
though the mind, by this illusion it has of gold value as a fixed thing,
cannot bring the actual gold back, what it can do is so to increase the
second factor, <strong>Efficiency in Circulation,</strong> as largely as
to make up for the lack of gold; and under the effect of this prices
will gradually rise again. In the same way, if the mass of current
medium by some accident becomes suddenly increased that should lead to
an equally sudden rise in prices; but the unconscious tendency of the
human mind to keep prices stable sets to work at once. Efficiency in
Circulation slows down, the new large amount of currency works more
sluggishly, and, though prices rise, they do not rise nearly as much as
the influx of money might warrant.</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that the factor in the making of prices called ”
Efficiency in Circulation ” works like a sort of automatic governor,
tending to keep prices fairly stable; but of course it cannot prevent
the gradual changes, and sometimes it cannot prevent quite sharp
changes, as we shall see a little later on. For the moment, the
interesting thing to note about Efficiency in Circulation is that we owe
to this factor in prices the creation of <em>paper money.</em></p>
<p>If, with only a certain stock of gold to work on, business rapidly
and largely increases, if a great many more things are made and
exchanged, then, as the gold will have a lot more work to do—and so
become more difficult to obtain in any one time or place—that should
have the effect, of course, of making it more valuable, that is, of
lowering prices.</p>
<p>Now with the beginnings of modern industry, about a hundred and fifty
years ago, a vastly greater number of things began to be made than had
ever been made before, and the number of exchanges effected multiplied
ten, twenty and a hundredfold. The stock of gold, though it was
increased in the nineteenth century by discoveries in Australia and
California, and later in South Africa, would have been quite unable to
cope with this flood of new work, and prices would have fallen very much
indeed, had it not been for the creation of <em>Paper Money.</em> Paper
money was a method of immensely increasing Efficiency in
Circulation.</p>
<p>This is how it worked.</p>
<p>A Bank or a Government (but especially the Bank of England, with the
guarantee of the Government) would print pieces of paper with the words:
“I promise to pay to the bearer of this Five Pounds.” Anyone who took
one of these pieces of paper to the Bank of England could get Five
Golden Sovereigns. But since this was publicly known, people were
willing to take the piece of paper <em>instead of</em> the five
sovereigns.</p>
<p>If you sold a man a horse for fifty pounds, you were just as willing
to take ten five pound notes for him as fifty sovereigns. They were more
convenient to carry, and you knew that whenever you wanted the actual
gold you had only to go to the bank and get it.</p>
<p>Because people were thus willing to be paid in paper instead of in
the actual gold, a large number of notes could be kept in circulation at
any one time, and only a small amount of gold had to be kept in
readiness at the Bank to redeem them. In practice it was found that very
much less gold than the notes stood for was quite enough to meet the
notes as they were brought in for payment. Much the most of the note
circulation went on going the rounds, and in normal times it took a long
time for a note on the average to be brought back to the Bank.</p>
<p>You can see that this dodge of paper money had the effect of
increasing the total <em>amount</em> of the current medium in practice,
and of greatly increasing its Efficiency in Circulation. Moreover, it
made the Efficiency in Circulation very elastic, because in times of
quiet business, more notes would go out of circulation and be paid into
the bank, while in time of active business more notes would go on
circulating.</p>
<p><em>So long as every note was redeemed in gold every time it was
brought to the bank, so long as the promise to pay was promptly kept,
the money still remained good; the paper currency did not interfere with
the reality of the gold values, there was no upsetting of prices, and
all went well.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Governments are under a great temptation, when they
have exceptionally heavy expenses, to falsify the Currency. People get
so much in the habit of trusting the Government stamp on paper or metal
that they take it as part of nature. What the Government is really doing
when it coins a sovereign is giving a guarantee that this little disc of
yellow metal contains 123 grains of gold with a certain known (and
small) amount of alloy to make the gold hard. When the Government has to
pay a large amount in wages, or for its Army and Navy, or what not, it
is tempted to put in less gold and more alloy and keep the old stamp
unchanged, and that is called “Debasing the Currency.”</p>
<p>For instance, the Government wants a hundred tons of wheat to feed
soldiers with, and the price of wheat in gold at that moment is Ten
Sovereigns a ton. It says to a merchant, “If you will give me a hundred
tons of wheat, I will give you a thousand sovereigns.” But when it comes
to paying the thousand sovereigns, instead of giving a thousand coins
with 123 grains of gold in each, it strikes a baser coin with only a
hundred or less than a hundred grains in each, and pays the merchant
with these. It is a simple form of cheating and always effective,
because the merchant thinks the sovereign is genuine. Only when these
bad sovereigns get into circulation they naturally find their level in
gold; for people begin to test them, and find that they have not got as
much gold in them as they pretend to have. Then, of course, prices as
measured in this new base coin rise. If the Government wants to buy
another hundred tons of wheat it must offer more than a thousand of the
base coins; it must offer, say, thirteen hundred of them. But again it
is tempted to put even less gold into the coins with which it pays for
the second lot of wheat, and so the coin gets baser and baser, until at
last, perhaps, a sovereign will not really be worth half what it
pretends to be. Governments in the past have done this over and over
again, but it was not until our time that the worst form of debasing the
coinage came in.</p>
<p>It came in as a result of the Great War, and we are all suffering
from it to-day. This last and worst form of debasing coinage worked, not
through cheating about the metal, but through a trick played with paper
money.</p>
<p>Before the war, if you got a Five Pound note saying “I promise to pay
Five Pounds” the promise was kept and the five golden sovereigns were
there for you whenever you went with your note to the bank and asked for
them; but when the Government had these very heavy expenses to meet on
account of the war, they first began making difficulties about paying
when people brought their paper to the bank, and at last stopped paying
altogether. At the same time, they did everything they could to get the
gold out of private people’s hands and to make them use paper money
instead. The consequence was that, people being so accustomed to think
of a paper guarantee of the Government exactly as though it were real
money, readily took to the new notes and used them as money, thinking of
these wretched bits of paper exactly as though they were so many golden
sovereigns. The Government could go on printing as many bits of paper as
it liked, and they would still be used as though they were real money.
So long as the amount of paper printed was not more than <em>would have
been printed</em> when the notes were redeemable, and when the currency
was on a true <em>“Gold Basis,”</em> no harm was done; but of course it
paid the Government to go on printing a great many more notes than that,
because, when it could make money thus cheaply, it could pay for
anything, however great the expense; but at the cost, of course, of
debasing the currency more and more.</p>
<p>This kind of money, forced upon people, pretending to be the same as
real money but actually without a Gold Basis, is called
<em>Fiat</em>money, and that is the kind of money the whole world has
to-day, except those countries which did not take part in the Great War,
and the United States which did not ever give up its gold basis.</p>
<p>Of the different European fighting countries, however, ours did best
in this matter. We are still living on Fiat money, and we have much more
of it than we ought to have. But the French have more in proportion, so
that prices measured in <em>their</em> money are now (1923) more than
three times what they would be in gold. The Italians are worse off
still. With them it is four times. With the Germans it is millions of
times, and their currency has quite gone to pieces; a paper coin in
Germany is worth (at the time I write, October, 1923) <em>ten
million</em> times less than the real metal coin which it is supposed to
represent.</p>
<p>This is one of the very worst things that has happened on account of
the war, for as the money now being used all over Europe is not real
money, no one feels certain whether he can get his debts really paid, or
whether his savings are safe, or whether a contract made for a certain
payment a few months hence will be really fulfilled or not. A man may
lend a thousand francs or marks or pounds for a year, and then at the
end of the year, when he is to be paid back, he may be paid in coin
which has got so much worse that he is really receiving only half or a
tenth or a thousandth of the real value he lent. A man in Germany sells
a hundred sheep for so many marks, to be paid for in a month; and at the
end of the month the marks will only buy ten sheep!</p>
<p>This piece of swindling, which has been the note of the last five
years, is the first point we have touched on so far where a problem in
Economics and the study of economic law brings one up against questions
of right and wrong.</p>
<p>It is morally wrong for the Government to swindle people out of their
property by making false money. What is the way out, allowing for
Economic Law? It is morally wrong that some men should starve while
other men have too much: allowing for Economic Law, what is the way out
of such evils?</p>
<p>As you go on in the study of Economics you find quantities of
questions where you have to decide whether economic laws render possible
political actions which you would very much like to undertake, and which
seem right and just. Many such actions, though one would like to
undertake them, cannot be undertaken because our study of Economics has
shown us that the consequences will be very different from what we
hoped.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a great many people try to get out of what it is
their duty to do politically by pleading that Economic Law prevents
it.</p>
<p>Before ending these notes, then, we must go into the main questions
of this kind, and see what there is to be said, in the light of economic
knowledge, for our present system of society, which is called
<strong>Capitalism;</strong> for other systems in the past such as
<strong>Slavery;</strong> for <strong>Private Property;</strong> for the
various theories of <strong>Socialism;</strong> for and against
<strong>Usury,</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>It is necessary to go into these points even in the most elementary
book on Economics, because the moment one begins the practical
application of one’s economic science these questions at once arise; to
answer them rightly is the most important use we can make of economic
knowledge.</p>

<h1>Political Applications</h1>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So far I have been putting down the elements of Economics just as one
might put down the elements of Arithmetic. But Economics have, just like
Arithmetic, a <em>practical application:</em> if it were not for this,
there would be no real use in studying Economics at all.</p>
<p>For instance: we find out, when we do the elements of Arithmetic,
that solid bodies vary with the cube of their linear measurements. That
is the general abstract principle; but the <em>use</em> of it is in real
life when we come {for instance) to measuring boats. We learn there from
Arithmetic that, with boats of similar shape, a boat twice as long as
another will be eight times as big; it is also by using the elements of
Arithmetic that we can keep household accounts and do all the rest of
our work.</p>
<p>It is precisely the same with Economics. We are perpetually coming
upon political problems which Economics illustrate and to which economic
science furnishes the answer—or part of the answer—and that is where the
theoretical elements of Economics have practical importance.</p>
<p>For instance: once we know the elementary economic principle that
rent is a surplus, we appreciate that it does not enter into cost of
production. We do not try to make things cheaper by compulsorily
lowering rent. Or, again, when we have learned the nature of money we
can appreciate the dangers that come from using false money.</p>
<p>In these political applications of Economics we also come upon what
is much more important than mere politics, and that is the question of
right and wrong. We see that such and such a thing ought to be so as a
matter of justice; but we may blunder, as many great reformers have
blundered, in trying to do the right thing and fading to do it, because
we have not made a proper application of our economic science. And the
opposite is also true: that is, a knowledge of Economics prevents their
being wrongly applied by those who desire evil. Many men take refuge in
the excuse that, with the best will in the world, they cannot work such
and such a social reform because economic science prevents their doing
what they know to be right. If we know our Economics properly we can
refute these false arguments, to the great advantage of our own souls
and of our fellow-men.</p>
<p>For instance: it is clearly our duty to-day to alleviate the fearful
poverty in which most Englishmen live. A great many people who ought to
know better say, or pretend, that economic laws prevent our doing this
act of justice. Economic laws have no such effect; and an understanding
of Economics clears us in this matter, as we shall see later on.</p>
<p>We have hitherto been following the statement and examination of
economic laws: that is, the <em>theoretical</em> part of our study and
its necessary foundation. Now we go on to the <em>practical</em> part,
or “Applied Economics,” which is the effect of those laws on the lives
of men.</p>
<p>Before leaving this Introduction I think it is important to get quite
clear the difference between what is called “theoretical” study and the
practical application of such study. People are very often muddle-headed
about this, and the more clearly we think about it the better.</p>
<p>A theoretical statement is a statement following necessarily and
logically from some one or more known first principles. Thus, we know
that two sides of a triangle are longer than the third, so we say it
follows <em>theoretically</em> that a straight road from London to
Brighton is quicker motoring than going round by Lewes. But the number
of first principles at work in the actual world is indefinitely large.
Therefore One must test any one theoretical conclusion by practice: by
seeing how it works. Because, side by side with the one or two first
principles upon which our theory is built, there are an indefinitely
large number of other first principles which come into play in the real
world. Thus there is, in motoring, the principle that speed varies with
road surface. So the way round by Lewes may be quicker than the straight
road if it has a better surface. There is yet another principle that
speed is checked by turnings in the road, and it may prove that on trial
the two ways are about equal.</p>
<p>Or again: we know that the tidal wave is raised on either side of the
earth, and that there is, therefore, about twelve hours of even ebb and
flow, six hours each on the average and taking the world as a whole:
because the earth takes twenty-four hours to go round.</p>
<p>But if you were to act upon that first principle <em>only</em> in any
one part of the world, and to say without testing the thing in practice,
“I can calculate the tide theoretically,” you would very often wreck
your ship. For many other principles come into play in the matter of the
tide besides this twelve-hour period. In one case the tide will be
delayed by shoals or by the current of a river. In another there may be
two or three tides meeting. In a third the sea will be so locked that
there will be hardly any tide for many hours, and then a rush at the
end—and so on.</p>
<p>Now it is just the same with Economics. Your economic first principle
makes you come to such and such a <em>theoretical</em> conclusion. But
there are a lot of other first principles at work, and they may modify
the effect <em>in practice</em> to any extent. When people object to
“theoretical dreaming,” as they call it, they mean the bad habit of
thinking that one conclusion from one particular set of first principles
is sufficient and will apply to any set of circumstances. It never does.
One has always to watch the thing in practice, and see what other forces
come in.</p>
<p>In the political applications of economic science we have to deal
with the effect of human society upon economic law. For instance:
economic law tells us that, given a certain standard of living for
labour—the “worth while” of labour—and a certain minimum profit without
which capital will not accumulate—the “worth while” of capital—there is,
as we have seen, a lowest limit of production; a set of conditions below
which production will not take place. Land which is below a certain
standard of fertility will not be farmed; a vein of metal below a
certain standard of yield will not be mined under such and such social
conditions. But all circumstances in which production has greater
advantages than this lowest limit produce a surplus value called “Rent.”
That is an economic law, and it is always true.</p>
<p>But it does not follow that the owner of the land, for instance, will
get the full economic rent of the land. There may be customs in society,
or laws, by which he is compelled to share with the tenant. The
theoretical economic rent is there all right, but one cannot deduce from
this truth that the landlord will necessarily and always get the whole
of it. And so it is with every other political application.</p>
<p>Having said so much by way of Preface, let us turn to the particular
problems, and first of all consider the idea which underlies all
practical economic conclusions, the idea of
<strong>Property.</strong></p>
<p>The very first governing condition of economic production and
distribution in the real world is the condition of <em>control.</em> Who
<em>controls</em> the process of production in any particular Society?
Who in it owns (that is, has the right and power to use or leave idle,
to distribute or withhold) the means of production, the stores of food
and clothing, and houses and machinery? On the answer to that question
depends the economic structure of a society. This control is called
<em>Property,</em> and as the first thing we have to study in practical
Economics is the character of <em>Property,</em> we will make that the
first division of our political applications.</p>
</section>
<section id="propertythe-control-of-wealth" class="level2">
<h2>Property—The Control of Wealth</h2>
<p>All the political application of Economics—that is, all the
application of Economic Science to the conduct of families in the
State—turns on The Control of Wealth, and of the things necessary to
make wealth.</p>
<p>The first thing to grasp is that <em>someone</em> must control every
piece of wealth if it is to be used to any purpose. Every bundle of
economic values in the community must be under the control of some human
will; otherwise those pieces of wealth “run to waste,” that is, are
consumed without use to mankind. For instance, a ton of threshed wheat
represents a bundle of economic values. It represents a piece of wealth
equivalent, in currency measure, to say £16. If no one has the right to
decide upon its preservation and use, when and how it is to be kept dry
and free from vermin, when and how it is to be ground and the flour made
into bread, then it will rot or be eaten by rats, and in a short time
its economic values will have disappeared. It will be worthless. The £16
worth of wealth will have been “consumed without use”; in plain
language, wasted. But if wealth were all wasted humanity would die out.
So men must, of necessity, arrange for a <em>control</em> of all wealth,
and this they do by laws which fix the control of one parcel of wealth
by one authority, of another by another; men make laws allowing such
control by some people and preventing attempted control by other people
not authorised. This lawful control over a piece of wealth we call
<em>Property</em> in it.</p>
<p>Thus, the coal in your cellar which you have bought is by our laws
your property. It is for you to bum it as you want it and when you
choose. If another person comes in and takes some of it without your
leave, to burn it as <em>he</em> chooses, he is called a thief and
punished as such. The coal in the Admiralty Stores is State property.
The State has the right to decide into what ships it is to be put and
how and when it is to be burnt, and so on. But whether the control is in
private hands such as yours, or in the naval authorities who’are
officers of the State, control there must always be.</p>
<p>When people say that they want to “abolish property,” or that “There
ought to be no property,” they mean <em>Private</em> property: the right
of individuals, or families, or corporations to control wealth. Property
in the full sense, meaning the control of wealth by <em>someone,</em>
whether the State, or private individuals, or what not, is inevitable,
and is necessary in every human society. So, granting that property must
exist, we will first examine the various forms it may take.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our examination we noticed that wealth, owned and
controlled by whoever it may be—the State, or an individual, or a
corporation—is of two kinds. There is the wealth which will be consumed
in enjoyment and the wealth which will be consumed in producing future
wealth.</p>
<p>The wealth which will be consumed in producing future wealth is, as
we have seen, called <em>Capital.</em> For instance: if a man has a ton
of wheat and eats half of it while he is doing nothing but taking a
holiday, or doing work which has some moral but no material effect—that
is not Capital. But if he uses the other half to keep himself alive
while he is ploughing and sowing for a future harvest, and keeps a
little of it for the seed of that harvest, all that he so uses is
<em>Capital.</em> Since control of wealth is necessary, no matter of
what kind the wealth be, it is clear that there must be property not
only in what is about to be consumed in enjoyment but also in Capital.
Someone, then, must own Capital.</p>
<p>But here comes in a very important addition. The fertility of land,
space upon which to build, mines of metal, water power, natural
opportunities of any kind and natural forces, <em>though they are not
wealth,</em>are the necessary conditions for producing wealth. Someone,
therefore, must control these also: someone must have the power of
saying, “This field shall be ploughed and sown thus and thus. This
waterfall must be made to turn this turbine in such and such a spot, and
the power developed must be applied thus and thus.” For if no one had
such power the fertility of the land, the force of the stream, would be
wasted.</p>
<p>Property, therefore, extends over two fields, one of which is itself
divided into two parts. A.—It extends over natural forces. B.—It extends
over wealth, and, in the case of B, wealth, it extends over B.i wealth
to be used for future production (which kind of wealth, when it is so
used, is called Capital), and also B.2 wealth which is going to be
consumed without the attempt to produce anything else: consumed, as the
phrase goes, “in enjoyment.”[^2] Natural forces may be grouped, as we
have grouped them in the first part of this book, under the conventional
term “Land.” So Property covers Land and Capital, as well as Wealth to
be consumed without the attempt to produce other wealth. You may put the
whole thing in a diagram thus:—</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In studying the social effects of Property it is convenient to group
together <em>Land</em> and that part of wealth which is used for further
production and is called <em>Capital,</em> and to call the two <em>“the
means of production”:</em> because, in a great many social problems the
important point is not who owns the Capital separately or the land
separately, but who owns the whole bundle of things which constitute the
“Means of Production,” without which no production can take place.</p>
<p>For instance: Supposing a man owns a hundred acres of fertile land,
that is his property, and though we call it wealth in ordinary
conversation it is not real wealth at all. It is only the opportunity
for producing wealth. If no one worked on that land, if no one even
worked so little as to take the trouble of picking fruit off the trees
or cutting the grass or looking after animals on it, it would be worth
nothing. Supposing another man to own the stores of food and the houses
and the clothing necessary for the livelihood of the labourers on the
land, and also the horses and the ploughs and the stores of seeds
necessary for farming, then that man owns the Capital only. But to the
<em>labourers</em> the important thing is that someone else owns the
“Means of Production,” <em>without which they cannot live,</em> and they
are equally dependent whether one or many control or own the <em>Means
of Production</em> in any particular case. Their condition has for its
main character <em>the fact that they do not own the “Means of
Production.”</em></p>
<p>Labour must be kept going. That is, human energy, for producing
wealth from land, while it is at work, waiting between one harvest and
another, will consume part of the stores of food and some proportion of
the housing (which is a perishable thing, though it only perishes
slowly) and of the clothing, and of the seed, etc. So we have to examine
the various ways in which labour (which is not wealth) and land (which
is not wealth) and capital (which is wealth) may be controlled.</p>
<p>There are three main types of human society which differ according to
the way in which control is exercised over these three factors of
Labour, Capital and Land. These three types are:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Servile State:</strong> that is, the state in which
the material Means of Production are the property of men who also own
the human agents of Production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Capitalist State:</strong> that is, the state in
which the material Means of Production are the property of a few, and
the numerous human agents of Production are free, but without
property</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Distributive State:</strong> that is, the state in
which the material means of Production are owned by the free human
agents of Production.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a fourth imaginary kind of state which has never come
into being, called the Socialist or Communist State. We will examine
this in its right place, but the only three <em>actual</em> states of
which we know anything in history and can deal with as real human
experiences, are these three just described: the <em>Servile</em> State,
the <em>Capitalist</em> State, and the <em>Distributive</em> State.</p>
<p>But, before going farther, we must get hold of a very important
principle, which is this:—</p>
<p><strong>The nature of an economic society is not determined by its
arrangements being universal, that is, applying without exception to all
the families of the State, but only by their applying to what is
called</strong> <em>The Determining Number</em> <strong>of the families
of the State: that is, in so great a proportion as to colour and give
its form to the whole society.</strong></p>
<p>No one can exactly define the amount of this “determining number,”
but we all know in practice what it means. For instance: we say the
English are a tall race, from 5½ to 6 feet high. But that does not mean
necessarily that the majority of the people are over 5½ feet. You have,
of course, to exclude the children, and there are a great number of very
short people and a few very tall people. It means that the general
impression conveyed when you mix with English people—the size of the
doors and the implements with which men work, and the clothes that are
produced, and the rest of it—turn upon the general experience that you
are dealing with a race of about that size—5½ to 6 feet. Or again, you
say that the <em>determining</em> number or proportion of our society
speaks English. That does not mean that they all speak English. Some are
dumb; some speak Welsh or Gaelic. Many speak with such an accent that
others with a different accent find it difficult to understand them. Yet
it is true to say that the society in which we live speaks English.</p>
<p>Now it is exactly the same with the economic conditions of society.
You may have a society in which there is a certain number of slaves, and
yet it is not a slave-owning society, because the number of free men is
so great as to give a general tone of freedom. Or you have, as we have
in England, a great deal of property owned by the State—barracks and
battleships and arsenals, some of the forests, and so on—but we do not
say that England is economically a State-owned society, because the
<em>determining</em> proportion of property is not owned by the State
but by private people. The general effect produced is one of private
ownership and not of State ownership.</p>
<p>One more principle must be set down before we go farther, and that is
that almost any society is mixed. A society of which the determining
proportion is slave-owning will yet certainly have a proportion of free
men; for if it did not there would be no one to own the slaves. In the
same way what is called a Capitalist Society, which I will describe in a
moment (and which is the society in which we now live in England) has a
great number of people not living under purely capitalist conditions. It
is mixed.</p>
<p>But, though only a <em>determining number</em> is required to mark
the character of a particular society, and though every society is
<em>mixed</em> in its character, it remains true that all societies we
know of, in the past or the present, fall into one of these three
groups—the Servile (that is, slave-owning), the Capitalist, and the
Distributive.</p>
<p>The definition of these three systems is as follows:—</p>
<p>1. In the Slave-owning Society, or <strong>servile state,</strong> a
certain minority owns a determining amount of the wealth and also of
land—that is, the means of production (land and capital) and the wealth
ready for consumption in enjoyment. The rest of the community is
compelled by positive law to give its labour for the advantage of these
few owners; and this rest of the community are, by economic definition,
(whether they call themselves by the actual name or not) slaves: that
is, they can be compelled to work for the owners, and can be punished by
law if they do not work for the owners.</p>
<p>2. In the <strong>capitalist state</strong> a determining number of
the families or individuals are free; that is, they cannot be compelled
by positive law to work for anybody. They are at liberty to make a
contract. Each can say to an owner of land or capital: “I will work for
you for so much reward, such and such a proportion of the wealth I
produce. If you will not give me that I will not work at all,” and no
one can punish him for the refusal.</p>
<p>But the mark of the Capitalist State is that a determining amount of
land and capital is owned by a small number of people, and that the rest
of the people—much the greater number—though free, cannot get food or
housing or clothing except in so far as the owners of these things (that
is, of the means of production) choose to give it them. In such a state
of society the people who own nothing, or next to nothing, are free to
make a contract and to say: “I will work on your farm” (for instance)
“if you will give me half or three-quarters of the harvest. If you will
not, I will not work for you.” But this contract is bound by a very hard
condition, for if they push their refusal to the limit and continue not
to work they will starve, and they will not be able to get housing
against the weather or clothes to wear.</p>
<p>We are living to-day, in England especially, in such a Capitalist
State. In such a state the free men who contract to sell their labour
often have a certain very small proportion of things on which they can
live for a short time. They have a suit of clothes and perhaps a little
money with which they can purchase a few days’ livelihood—some of them
more, some of them less. But the tone or colour of the society is given
by the fact <em>that the great majority, though free, are dispossessed
of the means of production, and therefore of livelihood, and that a
small minority controls these things.</em></p>
<p>The word “Capitalism” does not mean that there exists capital in such
a society. Capital exists in all societies. It is a necessary part of
human society and of the production of wealth, without which no society
can live at all. The word “Capitalism” is only “shorthand for the
condition we have just described: a condition where capital and land are
in few hands though all men are free.</p>
<p>3. The <strong>distributive state</strong> is a state in which a
determining number of the citizens, a number sufficient to colour the
habits, laws and conditions of the whole society, is possessed of the
means of production, as private property, divided among the various
families. The word “distributive” is an ugly, long word, only used for
want of a better; but the reason that we have to use such a tiresome
word is an odd and paradoxical reason well worth grasping. The
Distributive State is the natural state of mankind. Men are happiest in
such conditions; they can fulfil their being best and are most perfectly
themselves when they are owners and free. Now whenever you have natural
and good conditions, not only in Economics but in any other aspect of
life, it is very difficult to find a word for it. There is always a word
ready for odd, unnatural conditions: but it is often difficult to find a
word for conditions normal to our human nature. For instance: we have
the words “dwarf” and “giant,” but we have no similar common, short word
to describe people of ordinary stature. So it is with the Distributive
State. We have to use an ugly new word, because men more or less take
for granted this state of affairs in their minds, and have never thought
out a special word for it.</p>
<p>However, a name it must have; so let us agree to call that kind of
society in which most men are <em>really</em> free and dignified and
full citizens, not only possessing rights before the law, but
<em>owning,</em> so that they are at no other man’s orders but can live
independently, “The Distributive State.”</p>
<p>Then we have these three main types of Society within human
experience: the Servile, the Capitalist, the Distributive.</p>
<p>To put these three estates clearly before our minds, let us describe
the kind of thing you would see in any one of the three.</p>
<p>In the <em>Servile State,</em> as you travelled through the country,
you would most ordinarily see working on the fields men who were the
slaves of a master. That master would own the land and the seed, and the
food and the houses, and the horses and ploughs and everything, and
these men you would see working would be compelled to work for their
master, and he would have the right by law to punish them if they did
not.</p>
<p>If you were in a <em>Capitalist State</em> (as we are in England) the
men you would see working would, as a rule, be earning what are called
“wages,” that is, an allowance (actually of money but immediately
translated into food and clothes and house-room and the rest), which
allowance would be paid to them at fairly short intervals, and without
which they could not live. The ploughs and horses with which they would
be working, the seed they would be sowing, the houses they lived in
would be the property of another man owning this <em>capital,</em> and
therefore called <em>The Capitalist.</em> If you asked any one of these
men who were working whether he were <em>compelled</em> to work by law
he would indignantly tell you that he was not. For he is a free man; his
wages are paid him as a result of a contract; he has said: “I will work
for you for so much,” and no one could compel him to work if he did not
choose to work. But in this state of society a man without capital must
make a contract of this sort in order to live at all. He is not
compelled by law to work for another, but he is compelled by the
necessity of living to work for another.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you were travelling through a <em>Distributive State</em>
(Denmark is the best example of such a state in modern Europe) you would
find that the man working on the land was himself the owner of the land,
and also of the seed and of the horses and the houses, and all the rest
of it. He would be a free man working for his own advantage and for
nobody else’s. He would also have a share in the factories of the
country and be a part owner in the local dairies, sharing the profit of
those dairies where the milk of many farms is gathered together, turned
into butter and cheese, and sold.</p>
<p>This is what we mean by the three types of State. In each you would
find many exceptions, but each has its <em>determining number</em>—of
slaves in the one case, wage earners in the other, and independent men
in the third.</p>
<p>We will now take each of these three kinds of State separately and
see the good and evil of them and what the consequences of them are.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-servile-state" class="level2">
<h2>The Servile State</h2>
<p>The Servile State is that which was found among our forefathers
everywhere. It is the Servile State in which we Europeans all lived when
we were pagan two thousand years ago. For instance: In old pagan Italy
before it became Christian, or in old pagan Greece—both of them the best
countries in the world of their time and both of them, as you know, the
origins of our own civilisation—most of the people you would have seen
working at anything were slaves, and above the slaves were the owners:
the free men.</p>
<p>Since we are talking of the political applications of political
economy, we have to consider <em>human happiness,</em> which is the
object of all human living; and when we talk of “advantage” or
“disadvantage” in any particular economic state we mean its greater or
less effect on human happiness.</p>
<p>The great disadvantage of the slave-owning state is clearly apparent:
in it the mass of men are degraded: they are not citizens: they cannot
exercise their own wills. This is so evident and great an evil that it
must be set against ah the advantages we are about to notice. Slavery is
a most unhappy condition in so far as it wounds human honour and offends
human dignity; and that is why the Christian religion gradually
dissolved slavery in the process of many centuries: slavery is not
sufficiently consistent with the idea of man’s being made in the image
of God. Slavery can also be materially unhappy, if the masters are cruel
or negligent. The great mass of slaves in such a society might be, at
the caprice of their masters, very unhappy; and under bad phases of
those societies they <em>were</em> very unhappy.</p>
<p>But we must not be misled by the ideas that have grown up around the
word “slave” in the modern mind. Because we have no one in England
to-day who is called a slave and bought or sold as a slave, and no one
is yet compelled by law to work for another man, therefore we regard
slavery as something odd and alien; and because it is natural to dislike
things which are odd and alien, unaccustomed, we think of slavery as
something simply bad.</p>
<p>That is a great mistake. The Servile State had—and, if it comes back,
will have again—two great advantages: which were <em>personal
security</em> and <em>general stability.</em></p>
<p><em>Personal security</em> means a condition in which everybody,
master and man, is free from grave anxiety upon the future: can expect
regular food and lodging and a continuance of his regular way of
life.</p>
<p><em>General stability</em> means the continuance of all society in
one fashion, without the violent ups and downs of competition and
without the friction of unwilling, constantly interrupted labour—as in
strikes and lock-outs.</p>
<p>In the Servile State work always got done and was done regularly. The
owners knew “where they were.” With so much land and so many slaves they
were sure of a certain average annual produce. On the whole it was to
the advantage of a man to keep his slaves alive and fairly well fed and
housed. Also, the human relation came in, and a man and his slave, in
the better and simpler forms of the Servile State, would often be
friends and were usually in the same relation as people are to-day with
their dependents. For instance: in well-to-do houses of the Servile
State we know from history that certain slaves were often the tutors of
the children, and thus had a very important and respectable position,
and there were other slaves who acted as good musicians and architects
and artists. There was always the feeling of a fixed social difference
between slave and free, but this did not necessarily nor perhaps usually
lead to great unhappiness.</p>
<p>This stability and security which slave-owning gave to all society
(to the owned to some extent, and to the owners altogether) also
produced a very valuable effect, which is, the presence of
<em>leisure.</em> Because revenue was fairly certain, because this kind
of arrangement prevented violent fluctuation of fortune, competition in
excess, and the rest of it, therefore was there a considerable
proportion of people at any time who had ample opportunity for study,
for cultivating good tastes, for writing and building well, and judging
well, and—what is very important—for conducting the affairs of the State
without haste or the panic and folly of haste.</p>
<p>One alleged <em>economic</em> disadvantage of slave-owning must be
looked at narrowly before we leave this description of the Servile
State.</p>
<p>One often hears it said that slave labour is less productive than
free labour, that is, labour working at a wage under Capitalism. People
sometimes point to modem examples of this contrast, saying that places
like the Southern States of America, where slave labour was used a
lifetime ago, were less productive than the Northern States, where
labour was free. But though this is true of particular moments in
history, it is not generally true. Free labour working at a wage under
the first institution of capitalism—when, for instance, a body of
capitalists are beginning to develop a new country with hired free men
to work for them—will be full of energy and highly productive. But when
what is called “free labour”—that is, men without property working by
contract for a wage—gets into routine and habit, it is doubtful whether
it is more productive than slave labour. It is accompanied by a great
deal of ill-will. There is perpetual interruption by strikes, and
lock-outs,and the process of production cannot be as minutely and
absolutely directed by the small and leisured class as can slave labour.
<em>There is no reason why a free man working for another’s profit
should do his best.</em> On the contrary, he has every reason to work as
little as possible, while a slave can be compelled to work hard.</p>
<p>But whether slave labour be more or less productive is not so
important as the two points mentioned above, of advantage and
disadvantage. The disadvantages, as we have seen, are (1) that it
offends our human love of honour and independence, degrading the mass of
men, and (2) that it is so terribly liable to abuse in the hands of
cruel or stupid owners, or in conditions where great gangs of slaves
grow up under one owner who can know nothing about them personally and
is therefore indifferent to their fate. The <em>advantages</em> are
security and stability, running as a note throughout society and showing
themselves especially in the leisure of the owning classes, with all the
good fruits of leisure in taste, literary and artistic. It was a society
based on slavery which produced what is perhaps the best fruit of
leisure, and that is the profound and fruitful thinking out of the great
human problems. All the great philosophy and art of the ancients was
worked out by the free owners in the slave-owning states, and so was the
best literature ever made.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-capitalist-state" class="level2">
<h2>The Capitalist State</h2>
<p>The Capitalist State is that one in which though all men are free
(that is, though no one is compelled to work for another by law, nor
anyone compelled to support another), yet a few owners of the land and
capital have working for them the great mass of the people who own
little or nothing and receive a <em>wage</em> to keep them alive: that
is, a part only of the wealth they produce, the rest going as rent and
profit to the owners.</p>
<p>The Capitalist State is a recent phenomenon compared with the great
length of known recorded history. It is a modern phenomenon produced by
our white race alone, by no means covering the whole of that race, nor
the most of it, but of great interest to us in England because we alone
are, of all nations, an almost purely capitalist society.</p>
<p>Here again we can tabulate the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The chief moral advantage of Capitalism as compared with the
Slave-owning State is that <em>every man, however poor, feels himself to
be free and to that extent saves his honour.</em> He may be compelled by
poverty to suffer a very hard bargain; he may see himself producing
wealth for other men, of which wealth he is only allowed to keep a
portion for himself. To that extent he is “exploited,” as the phrase
goes. He feels himself the victim of a certain injustice. He remains
poor in spite of all his labour, and the man for whom he works grows
rich. But, after all, it is a contract which the free workman has made,
and he has made it as a citizen. If those who own nothing, or next to
nothing, in a capitalist state (this great majority is technically
called in economic language “the <em>proletariat</em>”) organise, they
can bargain, as our great Trade Unions do, with the few owners of their
means of livelihood and of production, and be fairly certain, for some
little time ahead, of a reasonable livelihood.</p>
<p>Another advantage of Capitalism, purely economic, is the
<em>effectiveness of human energy</em> under this system, at least,
<em>in the first part of its development.</em> We spoke of this in the
last section.</p>
<p>But the disadvantages are very grave indeed.</p>
<p>Under Capitalism the capitalist himself acts competitively and for a
profit. He does not, like the slave-owner, direct a regular, simple
machine which works evenly year in and year out. He is perpetually
struggling to rise; or suffering, through the rise of others, a fall of
fortune. He is always on the look-out to buy labour as cheaply as he can
and then to sell the product as dearly as he can. There is thus a
perpetual gamble going on, the owners of Capital rapidly growing rich
and poor by turns and a general insecurity gradually poisoning all the
owning part of society. A far worse insecurity affects the propertyless
majority. The Proletariat—that is, the mass of the State—lives
perpetually under the fear of falling into unemployment and starvation.
The lash urging the workman to his fullest effort is this dread of
misery. At first that lash urges men to intense effort, but later it
destroys their energy. Capitalism was marked by nothing more striking
when it first arose than by the immense expansion of wealth and
population which followed it. In every district which fell under the
capitalist system this expansion of total wealth and of total population
could be observed; and England, which has become completely capitalist,
had in the hey-day of its Capitalism—up to the present generation—a more
rapid rate of expansion in wealth and population than any other ancient
people. But already the tide has turned, and the inhumanity of such a
life is beginning to breed everywhere an ill-ease and revolt which
threaten our civilisation.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of Capitalism are, in the long run, so great that
now, after not more than a lifetime of complete Capitalism, and that in
only one State—the English State—nearly everybody is profoundly
discontented with it and many people are in violent rebellion against
it. This grinding and increasing insecurity which attaches to the
Capitalist system is killing it. No one is safe for the morrow.
Perpetual competition, increasing with every increase of energy, has led
to a chaos in human society such as there never was before. The mass of
the people, not being slaves, cannot be certain that they will be kept
alive. They live in a state of perpetual anxiety as to whether their
employment will continue; while among the owners themselves the same
anxiety exists in another form. The competition among them gets more and
more severe. The number of owners gets less, and even the richest of
them is more insecure than were the moderately rich of a generation ago.
All society is like a boiling pot, with individuals suddenly coming into
great wealth from below and then dropping out again; the whole State
suffers from an increasing absence of leisure and an increasing
turmoil.</p>
<p>There is, then, this very grave disadvantage of insecurity
everywhere, and particularly for the mass of the people, who live under
permanent conditions of insecurity; nearly all the wage-earners have had
experience at some time, longer or shorter, of insufficiency through
unemployment. Capitalism leaves free men under a sense of acute
grievance (which they would <em>not</em> feel if they were slaves,
accustomed to a regular and fixed status in society), and, what is
worse, Capitalism <em>in its later stages</em> need not provide for the
livelihood of the mass of citizens, and, in effect, <em>does not</em> so
provide.</p>
<p>The magnitude of these evils is obvious. A man who is a free man, a
citizen, able in theory to take part in the life of the State, equal
with the richest man before the law, yet finds himself living on a
precarious amount of necessaries of life doled out as wages week after
week; he sees his labour exploited by others and suffers from a sense of
injustice and oppression. The wealth of the small, owning, class does
not seem a natural adjunct to its social position, as it does in the
slave-owning state; for there is no tradition behind that class; it has
no “status,” that is, no general respect paid to it as something
naturally—or, at any rate, traditionally—superior to the rest of men.
Many a modem millionaire capitalist, exploiting the labour of thousands
of his fellows, is of a lower culture than most of his labourers; and,
what is more, he may in a few years have lost all his economic position
and have been succeeded by another, even baser than himself. How can the
masses feel respect for such a man in such a position of chance
advantage?</p>
<p>It is inevitable that a moral evil of this sort should make the whole
State unstable. You cannot make of great differences in wealth between
citizens a stable state of affairs, save by breeding respect for the
owners of great wealth. But the more the turmoil of Capitalism increases
the less respect these owners of great wealth either deserve or obtain:
the less do they form a class, and the less do they preserve traditions
of any kind. And yet it is under these very conditions of Capitalism
that there is a greater disparity of wealth than ever the world knew
before! It is clear that society in such a condition must be as unstable
as an explosive.</p>
<p>So much for the first great disadvantage of Capitalism, chaos. But
the second main disadvantage—the fact that Capitalism in its later
stages ceases to guarantee the livelihood of the people—is a little less
easy to understand. Indeed, most people who discuss Capitalism, even
when they strongly oppose it, seem unable to grasp this second
disadvantage—so let us examine it closely.</p>
<p>I have said that Capitalism, in its later stages, <em>does not
provide for the maintenance of the mass of the people.</em></p>
<p>To see how true this is, consider an extreme case.</p>
<p>Supposing one man were to own all the means of production, and
supposing he were to have in his possession one machine which could
produce in an indefinite amount all that human beings need in order to
live. Then there would be no economic reason why this one man should
provide wealth for anyone except himself and his family. He might turn
out enough things to support a few others whom he wanted for private
servants or to amuse him, but there would be no reason why he should
support the masses around him.</p>
<p>Now it is true that we have not yet come, under Capitalism, to so
extreme a case. But the moral applies, though modified, to Capitalism in
its last stages, when very few men control the means of production, when
machinery has become very efficient, and when the great mass of people
are dependent upon employment by the capitalist for their existence.</p>
<p>Consider that it is of the essence of Capitalism to keep wages down,
that is, to buy labour cheap. Therefore, the labourer who actually
produces, say, boots cannot afford to buy a sufficient amount of the
boots which he himself has made. The capitalist controlling the
boot-making machinery, when he has provided himself with a dozen pair of
boots, and the working classes of the community with such boots as their
wages permit them to buy, must either try to sell the extra boots abroad
(and that outlet can’t last long) or stop making them. He has restricted
the home market by the necessity of cheap labour, and you have the
absurd position of men making more goods than they need, and yet having
less of those goods available for themselves than they need: the
labourer producing, or able to produce, every year enough clothing for
ten years, and yet not being able to afford sufficient for one: the
labourer producing or able to produce ten good overcoats, yet not able
to buy one.</p>
<p>So under Capitalism in its last stages you have the abnormal position
of millions of men ready to make the necessaries of life, of machinery
ready to produce those necessaries, of raw material standing ready to be
worked up by the machinery if only labourers could be put on, and yet
all the machinery standing idle, the wealth not being produced, and the
mass who could produce it going hungry and ill-shod and badly clothed.
And the more Capitalism develops the more that state of things will
develop with it.</p>
<p>Now this gradual lessening of purchasing power on the part of the
working masses under Capitalism is <em>the destruction of the home
market</em>. Low wages make great masses of English bootmakers unable to
buy all the boots they would. Therefore the capitalist who owns the
boot-making machinery must try to sell his surplus abroad. But the
foreign countries, as they grow capitalist, suffer from the same
trouble: property being badly distributed and the wage-earners kept as
low as possible, their power to buy foreign goods also diminishes. Thus
you have <em>gradual destruction of the foreign market.</em> You get in
the long run the full working of what we will call the <em>“Capitalist
Paradox,”</em> which is that Capitalism is a way of producing wealth
which, in the long run, prevents people from obtaining the wealth
produced and prevents the owner of the wealth from finding a market.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, on the balance, the disadvantages of
Capitalism have proved, even after its short trial, overwhelmingly
greater than the advantages,</p>
<p>Capitalism arose in small beginnings rather more than 250 years ago.
It grew strong and covered the greater part of the community (in
England, at least) about 100 years ago. It came to its highest
development in our own time; and it is already doomed. People cannot
bear it any longer. Future historians looking back upon our time will be
astonished at the immense productivity of Capitalism, the enormous
addition to wealth which it made, and to population, in its early
phases; but perhaps they will be still more astonished at the pace at
which it ran down at its end. Urged by the extreme human suffering,
moral and material, which capitalism now produces, remedies have been
proposed, the chief of which is generally called Socialism, or, in its
fully developed form, Communism.</p>
<p>But before we talk of this supposed remedy, which has never been put
into practice (it is an imaginary state of things) we must describe the
third form of state—the Distributive State.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-distributive-state" class="level2">
<h2>The Distributive State</h2>
<p>A state of society in which the families composing it are, in a
determining number, owners of the land and the means of production as
well as themselves the human agents of production (that is, the people
who by their human energy produce wealth with those means of
production), is probably the oldest, and certainly the most commonly
found of all states of society. It is a state of society which you get
all through the East, all through Asia, and in all the primitive states
we know. It is the state to which men try to return, as a rule, after
they have blundered into any other, though the first state we
described—the Servile State—runs it very close as a thing suitable to
human nature; for we know that the Servile State did also last for
centuries quite normally and stably in the Pagan past.</p>
<p>The reason men commonly adopt the Distributive form of society, and
tend to return to it if they can, is that the advantages it presents
seem greater in most men’s eyes than its disadvantages.</p>
<p>The advantages are these:—</p>
<p>It gives freedom: that is, the exercise of one’s will. A family
possessed of the means of production—the simplest form of which is the
possession of land and of the implements and capital for working the
land—cannot be controlled by others. Of course, various producers
specialise, and through exchange one with the other they become more or
less interdependent, but still, each one can live “on his own”: each one
can stand out, if necessary, from pressure exercised against him by
another. He can say: “If you will not take my surplus as against your
surplus I shall be the poorer; but at least I can live.”</p>
<p>Societies of this kind are not only free, but also, what goes with
freedom, elastic—that is, they mould themselves easily to changed
conditions. The individual, or the family, controlling his or its own
means of production, can choose what he will do best, and can exercise
his faculties, if he has sufficient knowledge, to the best
advantage.</p>
<p>This arrangement also gives security, though not as much security as
the Servile State. Men in this position of ownership are not in dread of
the immediate future. They can carry on. They may, if they choose, make
a reserve of their produce to carry them over moments of difficulty. For
instance, they will probably have each a reserve of food to carry them
over a bad harvest or some natural disaster. Further, it is found in
practice that societies of this kind continue for centuries without much
change. They go on for generations with a property well divided among
them and everybody free, so far as economic situation is concerned. No
such society has ever been destroyed except by some great shock; and so
long as every shock can be warded off, this system of having the land
and the means of production controlled by the mass of the citizens as
private owners is enduring. There are districts of Europe to-day where
the system has continued from beyond the memory of man. Such a little
state as Andorra is an example, and many of the Swiss valleys. Further,
when the system has been laboriously reconstructed, when the mass of
families who used to be dispossessed have been again put into possession
of land and the means of production, we find that the state arrived at
is stable.</p>
<p>The best example of that sort of reconstruction to-day is to be found
in Denmark, but you have it also in a less marked fashion in most parts
of France and in most of the Valley of the Rhine, in Belgium and
Holland, in Norway, and in many other places. Wherever it has been
settled it has taken root firmly.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of such a system are, first, that though in
practice it is found usually stable, yet in theory it is not necessarily
stable, and in practice also there are some communities the social
character of which is such that the system cannot be established
permanently.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, with land and the means of production well
distributed among the various families, a few may by luck or special
perseverance and cunning, tend to buy up the land and implements of
their less fortunate neighbours, and nothing will prevent this but a set
of laws backed up by strong public opinion. In other words, people must
desire this state of society, and desire it strongly in order to
maintain it; and if the desire for ownership and freedom is weak this
distributive arrangement will not last.</p>
<p>In the absence of special laws, and a public opinion to back them,
the idler or the least competent or least lucky of the owners will
gradually lose their ownership to the more industrious or the more
cunning or more fortunate.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage which has often been pointed out is that a state
of society of this sort, though usually stable and enduring, falls into
a routine (that is, into a traditional way of doing things), which it is
very difficult to change. The small owner will not have the same
opportunities for travel and for wide experience as the rich man has,
and he will tend to go on as his fathers did, and therefore when some
new invention arises outside his society he will be slow to adopt it. In
this way his society becomes less able to defend itself from predatory
neighbours and goes under in war. For a society of this kind is unfitted
to the discovery of new things. Contented men feel no special spur to
discover or to act on such discovery. That is why we find societies in
which land and all the other means of production are well distributed
among the greater part of the families of the State becoming too
conservative—that is, unwilling to change even for their own
advantage.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not universally true. For instance: no society in
Europe has made more progress in agriculture than the Danish society of
small owners. But, take the world all over, this kind of state is
usually backward, that is, slow to take up improvements in production
and to avail itself of new discoveries in physical science.</p>
<p>There is also another disadvantage which the Distributive State has
when it is in competition with a Capitalist State, or even a Servile
State, and that is <em>the difficulty of getting a very large number of
small owners to put their money together for any great purpose.</em> The
small owner will probably have less opportunities for instruction and
judgment than the few directing rich men of a Capitalist or Servile
State, and even if he is, on the average, as well educated as these rich
men in neighbouring states, it will be more difficult to get a great
number of small owners to act together than to persuade a few large
owners to act together. Therefore highly Capitalist States, such as
England, will be found more enterprising than less Capitalist States in
their investments and commerce. They will open up new countries more
rapidly, and will get possession of the best markets.</p>
<p>Lastly, this disadvantage attaches to the Distributive State—that it
is not so easy in it to collect great funds for war or for national
defence, or for any other purpose, as it is in a Capitalist or Servile
State. You cannot tax a Distributive State as highly as you can tax a
Capitalist State. The reason is obvious enough. A family with, say, £400
a year finds it terribly difficult—almost impossible—to pay out £100 a
year in taxation. They live on a certain modest scale to which all their
lives are fitted, and which does not leave very much margin for
taxation. If you have a million such families with a total income of
£400 millions you may collect from them, say, a tenth of their wealth in
a year—£40 millions—but you will hardly be able to collect a
quarter—£100 millions.</p>
<p>But another society with exactly the same amount of total wealth,
£400 millions a year, only divided into very rich and very poor, a
society in which there are, say, 1,000 very rich families with £300,000
a year each, and a million families with rather less than £100 a year
each, is in quite a different situation. You need not tax at all the
million people with a hundred a year each, but the rich people, who
between them have £300,000,000 a year, can easily be taxed a quarter of
their whole wealth; for a rich man always has a much larger margin, the
loss of which he does not really feel.</p>
<p>By a very curious paradox, which it would take much too long to go
into in detail, but which it is amusing to notice, this power of taxing
a very highly capitalist community is one of the things which is
beginning to handicap our Capitalist societies to-day against the
Distributive societies. It used to be all the other way, and it seemed
common sense that countries where you could levy large sums for State
purposes of war or peace would win against countries where you could not
levy such sums for public purposes. But the fact that you can tax so
very highly a society of a few rich and many poor has been shown in the
last few years to have most unexpected results. The very rich men pay
all right; but the drain on the total resources of the wealth of the
State weakens it.</p>
<p>The money raised by taxation is spent on State servants—many of them
inefficient and idle.</p>
<p>Since it is so easy to raise large sums, there is a temptation to
indulge in all sorts of expensive State schemes, many of which come to
nothing. And this power of easy taxation, which was a strength, becomes
a weakness.</p>
<p>No one suspected this until taxation rose to its present height, but
now it is clearly apparent; and we in England might perhaps be in a
better way later on if there had been as much resistance to high
taxation here as there has been in countries where property is better
distributed.</p>

<section id="socialism" class="level2">
<h2>Socialism</h2>
<p>It remains to deal with a certain remedy which some people have
imagined would get rid of all the disadvantages of Capitalism once and
for all. This remedy is called <em>Socialism,</em> and Socialism, as we
shall see in a moment, must mean ultimately <em>Communism.</em></p>
<p>No one has ever succeeded in putting this remedy for the evils of
Capitalism into practice, and (though the matter is still very much
disputed) it looks more and more as though no one would ever be able to
put it into practice.</p>
<p>We have seen what the evils of Capitalism were and how they have
exasperated nearly everyone who has become subject to a capitalist state
of society. There is the increasing insecurity which everybody feels—all
the Proletariat and many of the Capitalists as well—whilst there is the
necessary tendency of Capitalism to leave a larger and larger proportion
of people unproductive, not making the wealth which is necessary for
their support, and therefore either kept in idleness by Doles out of the
wealth which is still produced (a process which cannot go on for ever)
or starving. Pretty well everyone wants to get rid of these evils and to
get out of the Capitalist system, and this idea of Socialism which we
are going to examine seemed, when it was first put forward, an easy and
obvious shortcut out of the Capitalist muddle. When we have looked into
it, we shall see how and why Socialism does not, in practice, turn out
to be a shortcut at all, but a blind alley.</p>
<p>Ever since men began to live in societies and to leave records, you
will find the poorer people, when their poverty became intolerable,
clamouring for a division of the wealth which the more fortunate
enjoy.</p>
<p>That is the main, obvious remedy to inequality of wealth; to divide
it up again. But such a scheme has nothing to do with Socialism, and
must not be mistaken for Socialism.</p>
<p>The Socialist theory was invented, or at any rate was first put
clearly, by a man of genius, Louis Blanc, who was Scotch on his father’s
side and French on his mother’s. He lived rather less than a hundred
years ago and the scheme which he and those around him started was
this:—</p>
<p>The Officers of the State were to own all the Means of
Production—machinery and land and stores of food, etc.—and they alone
should be allowed to own it. Individuals and families and corporations
might consume that portion of produced wealth allotted them by the State
after it had been produced, <em>but they might not use it for making
future wealth.</em> <strong>Any wealth used for the making of future
wealth, that is, Capital in any form, was to be handed over to the
officers of the state; and all land and natural forces were to be owned
for ever by the State.</strong> That scheme is Socialism, and from that
principle all Socialist ideas flow.</p>
<p>In this way, it was claimed, there would be no division of society
into Capitalists and Proletarians, no chaos of competition with its
alternating riches and ruin; insecurity would be done away with, and
insufficiency as well. Everyone in the country would be a worker, the
State itself would be the Universal Capitalist. So there would be no
struggle of capitalists going up and down one against the other, and no
unemployment or lack of necessaries for anyone.</p>
<p>Among the energetic and keen set of men who surrounded Blanc in Paris
was a certain Mordecai, who wrote under the name his father had assumed,
that of “Marx.” He wrote (in German) a very long and detailed book
describing the whole scheme, as well as describing the evils of
Capitalism, and showing how this scheme would remedy those evils. His
book was pushed forward by the people who were converted to the idea,
and that is why the theory of Socialism is now often called
“Marxism.”</p>
<p>For instance: the coal-mines and all the machinery of the coal-mines
and the houses in which the miners live and the stores of food and the
clothing, etc., which keep the miners alive while the coal is being
mined, that is during the process of production—all these, which now
belong to capitalists who make a profit out of the miners’ labour, would
then belong to the State, which would allot the coal produced to all who
needed it. So it would be with all farms, farming implements, and cattle
and horses and the stores of food and clothing and houses necessary to
the labourers on the land during the process of production. So it would
be with all stone-quarrying and timber-felling, and carpentry and
brick-making for the continued production of the houses necessary to the
producers during production. So it would be with all corresponding
material for making cloth for clothing. So it would be with everything
which was made in the whole country. The officers of the State would
share out the wealth produced, so that it would be consumed by all the
citizens, and there would be an end to the exploitation of one man by
another and to the uncertainty of living.</p>
<p>Communism is simply that form of Socialism in which all that is thus
shared out by the State would be shared equally, the State giving every
family an equal share in proportion to the numbers of people which had
to be supported in the family, from one upwards.</p>
<p>The reason I have called Communism the logical and only possible
ultimate form of Socialism is that there could be under Socialism no
reason for any other form of distribution.</p>
<p>Some time ago certain Socialists used to try to get out of this
necessity for Communism, so as not to frighten rich people with their
proposals for reform. They would say to a man who was making, say,
£5,000 a year because he owned a lot of capital and land and had rents
and profits coming to him from the work of his labourers: “You will have
just as much under Socialism, for we recognise what a superior kind of
person you are, and when the State shares out its wealth among its
citizens it will give you as much as you have now, leaving the same
difference between rich and poor, only seeing to it that the poor always
at least have enough to live on. Where we give one ticket to the
labourer to claim out of the common stores what he wants for a week we
will give you fifty tickets, so that you will get fifty times as much if
you like.” But of course this was nonsense, and was soon discovered to
be nonsense. With everybody working for the State under orders all would
naturally claim equality, and there would be no way of preventing their
getting an equal share except force. In justice, supposing a Socialist
state to arise, there could be only the Communist form of it.</p>
<p>This scheme has never been put into practice, and when we look
closely at it we shall discover, I think, why it never will be put into
practice.</p>
<p>The reason it cannot be put into practice is this: Although we use
the words “the State” this mere idea means in practice real men who act
as officials to represent the State. Actual men with their varying
characters, good and bad, lazy and industrious, just and unjust, have
got to undertake the enormous business <em>first</em> of running
production in the interest of all, <em>next</em> of distributing the
resultant wealth equally to all.</p>
<p>Now there are two qualities in man which make action of this sort
break down. The first is that men love independence—they like to feel
themselves their own masters. They like therefore to own, so that they
may do what they like with material things. The next is that men like to
get as much as possible of good things. Both these feelings are
universally true of the human race. You will find exceptional people, of
course, who are just as contented with a little as with a great deal,
and you will find exceptional people who do not care about independence
or about owning, and who are quite willing to be run by other people, or
to give up all possession for the sake of some special way of living:
that is, there is a comparatively small number of men and women who, in
order to live free from responsibility, or in order to devote themselves
to religion or to some form of study and contemplation, will give up all
property and have the material side of their lives administered for
them. But men and women in general will both want to get all they can of
good things with the least possible exertion in the getting of them, and
they will also desire freedom to exercise their own wills and deal with
material objects as they choose.</p>
<p>Now the Socialist scheme requires both these very strong emotions,
common to all mankind, to be suppressed. The people who run the
State—that is the politicians—are to be absolutely just (although there
is no one to force them to be just), they are to forget all personal
wishes and to think of nothing but the good of those whose labour they
direct and among whom they share out the wealth that is produced. We
know by experience that politicians are not angels of this sort. It is
absurd to imagine that men coveting public office (and living the life
of intrigue necessary to get it) would suddenly turn into unselfish and
devoted beings of this ideal kind. You cannot give this enormous power
to men without their abusing it.</p>
<p>The second force making against the establishment of Socialism is
still stronger. You will never get the run of men and women contented to
live their whole lives entirely under orders. In exceptional moments a
large part of individual freedom will be given up to the necessity of
the State—as during the Great War; for if the State did not survive the
individual’s life and that of his children would not be worth living.
The individual in abnormal crises goes through a great deal of suffering
for a moment in order that he and his should have less pain in the long
run. But even in such crises a large part of liberty remains to him.
Under Socialism he would have none. He would have to do what he was told
by his task-masters, much more than even the poorest labourers now have
to do what they are told by task-masters. And there would also be this
difference: that <em>everyone</em> would be in that situation and there
would be no way out. Not a part of life, nor so many hours a day, but
the whole of life, would be subject to orders given by others. This,
humanity would certainly find intolerable.</p>
<p>That is why, I think, Socialism has never been put into practice and
never can be put into practice. There have been attempts at it, but even
when they are sincere and not the mere product of alien despotism they
break down. As in Russia to-day, where, whether the Jew adventurers who
seized power were sincere or mere tyrants, they have, in spite of their
attempt at seizing all the soil and keeping the peasants dependent on
them, been compelled at last to let nearly all the nation live as owners
tilling their own land.</p>
<p>It is no reply to this to say that the State always has owned, and
actually can and does own, <em>some</em> part of the means of Production
(such as the Post Office and certain forests and lands here in England,
and, abroad, most mountain land, all mines and much else) and direct
them with success. The point of Socialism—the one condition necessary to
its existence—is that the State should own <em>all</em> the means of
Production that really count. Between the normal exercise of a partial
function and the abnormal exercise of a universal function is all the
difference between <em>plus</em> and <em>minus.</em> A partial State
ownership working in a society the determining character of which is
private ownership is an utterly different thing, even an
<em>opposite</em> thing to general State ownership determining the
character of Society and allowing only exceptional private ownership.
Socialism can only be <em>(a)</em> good <em>(b)</em> possible when men
desire, and are at ease in, the latter kind of state; that is, desire
and are at ease in complete forgetfulness of self coupled with justice
as men ruling, and complete surrender of personal honour and freedom and
appetite as men ruled.</p>
</section>
<section id="international-exchange" class="level2">
<h2>International Exchange</h2>
<p>International exchange is not really different from the domestic
exchanges which go on within a nation. The foreigner who has some
product of his own to exchange against a product of ours deals as a
private man with other private men, and if you could see all the
exchanges of the world going on you would not distinguish between the
character of an exchange, say, between Devonshire and London and one
between London and the Argentine. The Devonshire man grows wheat, which
he sells perhaps in a London market, and buys manufactured products
which a merchant in London provides. The farmer in the Argentine does
much the same thing, sells wheat and receives in exchange what
manufactures he needs, precisely as though he were living in Devonshire
instead of abroad. He does not trade with “England,” but with a
particular merchant or company in England.</p>
<p>But there are certain points about international trade which one must
get clear unless one is to make mistakes in the political problems
arising out of it.</p>
<p>In the first place, international trade is always subject to a
certain interference which domestic trade does not suffer. All countries
have a <em>tariff,</em> that is a set of taxes upon a great number of
the articles coming in from abroad. Even those countries which, as
England did until quite lately, believe in leaving their citizens on
equal terms with foreign competitors and have gone in for complete free
trade, examine all goods at the port of entry or at special points on
the frontier, both in order to raise revenue and to keep out undesirable
goods, such as certain drugs; nor does any country allow all things to
come in unexamined, lest forbidden things should come in unobserved.
Moreover, it is important to measure the nature and volume of a nation’s
foreign trade, and this cannot be done without stopping things at the
ports or frontiers and examining them.</p>
<p>In general, international trade differs from domestic trade first of
all in this—that it always has to pass through an examination at the
frontiers through which it enters. It also differs from domestic trade
in that it has to use another currency. Even when all countries have a
gold currency, there are certain small fluctuations in the exchange
values of the different currencies. For instance: before the war the
English pound was worth in gold about 25¼ French francs, but you hardly
ever had this “Parity” (as it is called) exact. The franc would
fluctuate slightly against the sovereign—sometimes above, sometimes
below “Parity” by a penny, or even sometimes more than a penny, one way
or the other. With many countries whose currency was not in a good
condition the fluctuations would be more violent, and of course since
the war, now that so many nations no longer have a gold currency at all,
but a fictitious paper currency, the value of one currency against
another fluctuates wildly. Within a year you could get only 50 francs
for an English sovereign and then a little later as much as 80
francs.</p>
<p>Within one country exchanges can be simply conducted by counting all
values in the currency of the country; but international trade,
involving the use of two or more currencies, cannot be so simple.</p>
<p>There is also a third point in international trade which must be
understood, and which proceeds from the very fact that international
exchanges do not essentially differ from the exchanges which take place
within the same country, and that is the fact that exchanges are not
simple contracts between two parties, but follow a whole chain of
contracts, covering a great number of parties.</p>
<p>We saw, in the first part of this book, that exchange even within one
country, was not simple barter but &amp;</p>
<p>In domestic exchange a farmer sells his wheat to a broker, but does
not purchase a lorry from the same buyer: he receives money from the
buyer, and with that money buys a lorry, say, a month later. But what
has really happened is a whole chain of exchanges in between the wheat
and the lorry—a miller has bought the wheat from the broker, a baker the
flour from the miller, and so on until towards the end of the chain a
caster has sold castings to a motor maker who has assembled them and
sold the lorry to the farmer.</p>
<p>It is the same with international exchanges; as we saw in the earlier
part of this book. There is an international chain of exchanges.</p>
<p>The total number of units engaged in this international chain may be
as large as you like; there may be ten or fifty or a hundred links
before it is complete. But the universal principle holds that imports
and exports usually balance. Whatever you import from abroad into a
country you must, as a general rule, pay for by exporting an equivalent
set of values created within your own country. But there are certain
exceptions to this rule which are sometimes lost sight of.</p>
<p>In the first place, the imports and the exports need not all be what
are called “visible” imports and exports. Many of them may be, and some
always are, “invisible.” The most obvious example of these are
“freights,” that is, sums paid for the carriage of goods between one
country and another. Thus, in the old days before the war you would find
England importing more than she exported, and one of the principal
reasons for the difference was that the imports were mostly brought in
English ships. Thus if a man in the Argentine were sending 50 tons of
wheat to England worth £500, England, after a long chain of trade with
many countries, including the Argentine, would be exporting values
against this £500 worth of wheat, which would be worth, say, not £500,
but only £450. The difference of £50 was made up by the cost of bringing
the wheat from the Argentine to England <em>in an English ship.</em> In
other words, £50 worth of the total £500 worth of wheat stood for the
sum which the man in the Argentine had to pay to the English sailors to
bring his wheat over the sea.</p>
<p>Further, a wealthy or strong country very often levied tribute upon a
poorer or weaker one, and this tribute might take several forms. There
was the tribute of <em>interest upon loans.</em> If English bankers had
lent to people in Egypt a million pounds with interest at forty thousand
pounds a year Egyptian production would have to export to England,
either directly or roundabout through the chain of trade, forty thousand
pounds’ worth of goods, against which England had not to send out
anything.</p>
<p>Another form of tribute—though a small one—is that paid in pensions.
A man having worked all his life in the Civil Service in India (for
instance) would retire upon a yearly pension of a thousand pounds a
year; but this pension was levied upon the taxpayers of India, and if
the man came to live in England and spent his pension there—as nearly
all of them did—it meant that India had to export a thousand pounds’
worth of goods every year to England, against which England sent nothing
back.</p>
<p>In the same way the shareholder in some works or firms situated in a
foreign country would, if he lived in England, cause an import to come
in equivalent to his dividends or profits, and against that England
would send out nothing.</p>
<p>But the point to remember is, that <em>the mere volume of trade</em>
(that is, <em>the total of things imported and of things exported</em>)
<em>is no indication of the wealth or prosperity of the country
importing and exporting.</em></p>
<p>A country may be very wealthy, although it is doing hardly any
international trade, because it may be producing within its own
boundaries a great deal of wealth of a kind sufficient to nearly all, or
all, its needs. Again, of international trade (and it is exceedingly
important to remember this, because most people go wrong on it)
<em>nothing increases the wealth of a country except the
imports.</em></p>
<p>It ought to be quite clear, especially in the case of an island like
Great Britain, that it <em>loses</em> what it sends out and
<em>gains</em> what it brings in. Yet people get muddled about even this
very simple proposition, because the individual trader thinks of his
transactions as an individual sale. He does not consider the nature of
trade as a whole. The individual trader, for instance, who makes
locomotives and exports them, gets paid, let us say, £10,000 for each
locomotive. In point of fact this means that in the long run he or
someone else in England will exercise £10,000 worth of demand for
foreign goods. But the individual trader does not usually think of that;
he thinks only of his own transactions, and he would be very much
surprised if he were told that his sending the locomotive abroad was,
<em>regarded in itself, and apart from the import which it assumed,</em>
a loss to the country of £10,000 worth of wealth.</p>
<p>You often hear people in political arguments talking as though the
falling off of exports from a country were a bad thing and the increase
of imports also a bad thing. It cannot t&gt;e so in the long run. The
excess of imports over exports is the national profit on the whole of
its foreign transactions, and any country which is exporting regularly
more than it imports is paying tribute to foreigners abroad, while every
country which regularly imports more than it exports is receiving
tribute.</p>
<p>Of course, if you consider only a short period of time, the falling
off of exports may be a bad sign; for it may mean that the corresponding
imports will not be gathered. If in this country we saw our exports
regularly falling year by year we should be right to take alarm, for
this would almost certainly mean that a corresponding falling off in
imports would sooner or later take place also, and that therefore our
total wealth would be diminished. But considered over a sufficient space
of time, it is obvious that the excess of imports over exports is a gain
and that the excess of exports over imports is a loss.</p>
<p>One last thing to remember about international trade is that the very
different importance of foreign trade to different countries makes the
foreign politics of nations differ equally. A country which can supply
itself with all it needs is free to risk its foreign trade for some
other issue. A country importing its necessities cannot risk the loss of
such trade, for it is a matter of life and death. The United States is
in the first position. It has within its own boundaries not only all the
minerals it needs, but also all the petrol and all the raw material for
making cloth, and all the leather for boots, and all the rest of it. But
a country like England is in quite a different position. We only grow
half the meat we need and about one-fifth of the com. Therefore it is
absolutely necessary for us to have a foreign trade. If all the foreign
trade of the United States were to be destroyed to-morrow, the United
States, though somewhat poorer, would still be very rich and able to
carry on without the help of anyone else. But if our foreign trade were
destroyed there would be a terrible famine and most of us would die.</p>
<p>Nations differ very much in this respect, but of all nations Great
Britain is that which is most vitally interested in maintaining a great
foreign trade, and next after Great Britain Belgium is similarly
interested, for Belgium also needs to import four-fifths of its
bread-stuffs. Almost every country except the United States
<em>must</em> have some foreign trade if it is to live normally. For
instance: France, though largely a self-sufficing country, has no
petrol. It has to buy its petrol abroad and must export goods to pay for
that import. Nor has it quite enough coal for its needs, and, before the
war, it had not nearly enough iron. Italy has no coal, no petrol and no
iron to speak of—not nearly enough for its needs. And so it is with
pretty well every nation in Europe. But of all nations our own and
Belgium—our own particularly—are in the most need of maintaining a large
foreign trade.</p>
<p>This affects all our policy, it is the root of both the greatness and
peril of England. It also tends to make English people judge the wealth
of foreigners by the volume of their trade, and that is a great
error.</p>

<h2>Free Trade and Protection as Political Issues</h2>
<p>In this matter of international trade there rose up, about a hundred
years ago, a great political discussion in England between what was
called <em>Free Trade</em> and what was called <em>Protection.</em></p>
<p>This discussion is still going on and affecting the life of the
country, and it is important to understand the principles of it, for we
have here one of the chief applications of theoretical Political Economy
to actual conditions.</p>
<p>I dealt with this subject briefly in the first part of this book
under “Elementary Principles,” but I return to it here in more detail
because it has given rise, in political application, to the most
important economic discussion in modern England.</p>
<p>The Free Traders were those who said that England would be wealthier,
as a whole, if there were no restriction upon exchange at all, whether
internal or external. A man having something to exchange with his
English neighbour was, of course, free to exchange it without any
interference; but the Free Trader’s particular point was that a man
having something to exchange with a <em>foreign</em> purchaser should be
equally free to exchange it, without any interference at the ports in
the way of export duty taxing the transaction. In the same way he said
that the foreigner should be perfectly free to send here any goods he
had to exchange against ours, and should neither be kept out by laws nor
restricted by special import duties at the ports.</p>
<p>“In this way,” said the Free Traders, “we shall get the maximum of
wealth for the whole country.”</p>
<p>The Protectionists, on the other hand, said: “Here are a lot of
people engaged on a particular form of production in England. Those who
have their capital in it are making profits, those who own the land on
which the capital is invested are getting rents, and the working people
are getting wages. The foreigner, having special advantages for this
kind of production, which make him able to produce this particular thing
more cheaply than we can, brings in that cheaper produce and offers it
for sale to Englishmen. The people to whom it is offered for sale will,
of course, buy the foreign stuff because it is cheaper. The result will
be that the English people who have invested their capital in producing
this particular thing—that is, who have got implements together and
buildings, and the rest, suitable for producing this thing—will be
ruined. It will not be worth their while to go on, for no one will buy
their goods. Their profits will be extinguished, and their capital will
decay to nothing. The rents on the land they occupy will also disappear,
and, what is worst of all, the large population which live on wages
produced by this kind of work will starve or have to be supported, idle,
by other people. Their power of producing wealth will be lost to
England. Therefore, let us tax this cheap foreign import so that our
production at home shall be <em>protected.</em> Let us tax the foreign
goods as they come in, so that the cost of producing abroad, with this
tax added, comes to at least as much as the cost of producing the same
stuff at home. In this way it will still be worth while for our people
at home to go on producing this kind of thing. The Englishman at home
will be just as ready to buy his fellow-citizen’s produce as the
foreigner’s, for the price of each will be the same.”</p>
<p>The Protectionist even said: “Let us make this tariff so high that
the foreign goods are sold at a <em>dis</em>advantage—that is, let the
tax on the foreign goods be such that, added to the cost of production
abroad, they cannot be sold in England save at a <em>higher</em> price
than the English goods. In this way only the English goods will be
bought here and the home industry will flourish as it did before.”</p>
<p>Such were the two political theories, standing one against the
other.</p>
<p>Now let us look into the economic principles underlying these two
opposing parties, and see which of them had the best of the
argument.</p>
<p>We have already seen, in the first part of this book, the elementary
economic principle that Exchange is only the last stage in the process
of production.</p>
<p>And we have also had fixed the principle that <em>freedom of exchange
tends to produce a maximum of wealth within the area to which it
applies,</em> and that interference with freedom of exchange tends to
reduce the total possible wealth of that area. This is so obvious that
all the great modem nations are careful to let exchange be as free as
possible <em>within their own boundaries.</em></p>
<p>Goods can be freely exchanged without interference all over the
United States and all over Great Britain and all over France, etc.,
because if you were to set up tolls and interferences with exchange
<em>within</em> the country the total wealth of the country would
necessarily be diminished.</p>
<p>Now the Free Traders extended this principle to foreign trade. They
said: “If the foreigner comes to us with something which he can sell to
us cheaper than we can make it ourselves that is an advantage to us, and
it is short-sighted to interfere with it under the idea that we are
benefiting the existing trade which is threatened by foreign
competition. For it means that we are producing something with
difficulty which we could get with much less work if we turned our
attention to things which we can produce with ease. Or, again, it means
that with the same amount of work devoted to things we make well and
exchange against the foreigner’s goods we shall get much more of the
things which the foreigner can make more easily than we can.”</p>
<p>If we take a concrete example we shall see what the Free Traders’
argument means.</p>
<p>Supposing people in this country had never heard of foreign wine, but
had to make their wine out of their own grapes grown in hot-houses, and
at great expense, the wine coming, let us say, to £1 a gallon. Meanwhile
we are producing easily great quantities of coal because we have great
coal-mines near the surface. We come to hear of people living in another
climate who can grow grapes easily in the open, who need much less
labour and capital to ripen them than we do in our artificial way in
hot-houses, and who can therefore send us wine at 10s. a gallon. Then we
can get for each £1 worth of labour and capital twice as much wine as we
got before. Instead of wasting our time artificially growing grapes in
hot-houses to make our wine, let the people who used to work in the
hot-houses become coal-miners, so that more coal may be produced and
this extra coal exchanged for foreign wine. A pound’s worth of labour
and capital in coal will get us 2 gallons of wine from the foreigner
when the same amount of labour and capital used in making the wine
ourselves would only get us one gallon. Let the capital that used to
keep up the hot-houses be spent in developing mines, and we shall find
as a result that we are as rich as ever we used to be in coal and richer
in wine. Our total wealth will be increased.</p>
<p>In the particular case of the English dispute about Free Trade and
Protection not wine but a much more important thing was concerned,
namely food; and that was what gave the political discussion its
practical value and made it so violent. It is also because food was in
question that the Free Traders won, and that England was, for a whole
lifetime, up to the Great War, a Free Trade country—that is, a country
allowing all foreign produce to come in and compete on equal terms with
home produce.</p>
<p>This country, at the beginning of the discussion a hundred years ago,
was already producing great quantities of manufactured goods: cloth and
machinery, ships and so on. It also produced on its fields the wheat and
meat and dairy produce with which it fed itself. But as the population
increased the amount of food being produced on the soil of England,
though getting larger in the total, got smaller in proportion to the
rapidly increasing population. Therefore there was a danger of its
getting dearer. The Free Traders said: ” Let foreign food come in free.
If it is produced in climates where for the same amount of labour you
can get more wheat and more meat and more dairy produce then, of course,
many of our agricultural people will have to give up working on the
land. But they can take to manufacturing, and the total amount of food
which the English will get for so much labour on their part will be
greater. Where an agricultural labourer working an hour, for instance,
can get a pound’s weight of food, the same man working one hour in a
factory will get, say, by exchange of the manufacture against foreign
food, two pounds of food, if we allow all foreign food to come in
free.”</p>
<p>These Free Trade arguments look, when they are first studied, not
only simple and clear, but unanswerable, and indeed most educated
men—nearly all educated men—in Queen Victoria’s reign, thought they
<em>were</em> unanswerable, and that Protectionists here at home (who
were no longer allowed to put their theories into laws) and
Protectionists abroad who had kept up tariffs against foreign trade,
were simply ignorant and foolish men who did not properly understand the
elements of Economic Science.</p>
<p>To see whether the Free Traders were right or wrong in these ideas,
let us next turn to the arguments with which the Protectionists met
them.</p>
<p>These arguments were of two kinds:—</p>
<p><em>(a)</em> There were Protectionists who said: “We cannot follow
all these elaborate abstract discussions about a science called
Economics; we are practical men with plenty of common sense and
experience, and all we know is that if the foreigner comes in free we
shall be ruined. He can sell his wheat at such a price that our farmers
will lose on it. Our labourers will leave the land, the rents paid to
our landlords will vanish. You will thus ruin English wealth
altogether.”</p>
<p><em>(b)</em> There was another kind of Protectionist who said: “You
Free Traders take for granted, and depend upon, one capital point, to
wit, <em>that the labour now employed in a particular form of
production, and the capital employed in it, both of which will be
destroyed by Free Trade, can be used more profitably in some other form
of Production.</em> But we, the Protectionists, say that, in the
particular case in question, they would <em>not</em> be used more
profitably. We say that, in point of fact, things being as they are, the
national character being what it is, the arrangements of our English
society and its traditions being what we know them to be, the ruined
industry will go on getting worse and worse, artificially supported by
relief from the community outside it, the farmer losing year after year
and still hanging on, the land going back to weeds and marsh, the
buildings falling down, and so forth. <em>We</em> say that, though it
may theoretically be possible to use in other ways the labour and
capital thus displaced, in practice you will destroy more wealth than
you will create.”</p>
<p>These two kinds of arguments on the Protectionist side are still to
be heard everywhere to-day.</p>
<p>It ought to be perfectly clear to anyone who thinks about the matter
at all that argument <em>(a)</em> was nonsense, for people and capital
driven out of an industry ill suited to our present conditions are not
thereby destroyed. They may very well find employment producing more
total wealth in another. But argument <em>(b)</em> was a good argument
if the statement about the impossibility of changing from one trade to
another were in practice true. The whole discussion really turned upon
the last point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Protectionists, those who defended their cause
in this country nearly all used argument (a), and were very properly
derided as fools by the Free Traders. Argument (b) was only used by a
comparatively small number of thoughtful men and they were under this
disadvantage— that they were arguing with regard to a possible or
probable future with no past experience to guide them, and that many
years must pass before it could be discovered whether, in practice, what
they said was true or false; whether in practice the ruin of English
agriculture would diminish the well-being of England as a whole or
not.</p>
<p>Further, the population continued to increase at a great rate, and
that all in the towns and on the coal-fields. Our manufacturing
productions went up and up and up, the total wealth of the country
enormously increased, and these processes hid and made to seem
insignificant the corresponding decay of the fields. We had no need for
Protection in any domestic manufactured goods; we had begun to use coal
before anybody else; we had developed machinery before anybody else. The
only thing which there could be any point in protecting was agriculture,
and that would have meant dearer food for the wage-earners in the
towns.</p>
<p>The great consequence was that Free Trade won hands down, and for a
long time all its opponents, however distinguished or reasonable, were
laughed at.</p>
<p>But if we wish to be worthy students of Economic Science we cannot
dismiss the quarrel so simply. There is such a thing as a strong
<em>economic</em> argument in favour of Protection in particular
circumstances. The practical proof of this truth is the immense increase
in wealth which took place in the German Empire during the thirty years
before the Great War, which increase exactly corresponded with a highly
protective tariff. The same thing happened in the United States at the
same time. But the theoretical argument in favour of Protection is much
better, because the increase of wealth in Germany and the United States
under Protection might be due to other causes, whilst it can be shown by
reason that Protection itself, in particular cases, increases the total
national wealth. With the proof of this I will end the present
chapter.</p>
<p>We have seen that the following formula is true:– <em>Freedom of
exchange tends to increase the total amount of wealth of all that area
which it covers.</em></p>
<p>But what gives the argument for Protection, in special cases, its
value is, as we saw on page 64, a second Formula equally true. Though
freedom of exchange tends to increase the total wealth of an area over
which it extends, <em>yet it does not tend to increase the wealth of
every part of that area.</em> Therefore, if a part of the area over
which freedom of exchange extends finds itself impoverished by the
process, it may be enriched by interfering with freedom of exchange over
the boundaries of its own special part.</p>
<p>Therein lies the whole argument for Protection in particular
cases.</p>
<p>Let us take for example three islands, two close together and one far
away and prove the case by figures.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/ThreeRegions.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We will number them A, B, C. Island A is full of iron ore. Island B
is full of coal. Island C is also full of iron ore, like No. A, but it
is a long way off.</p>
<p>Iron ore naturally comes to the coal area to be smelted, because,
being heavier, it can be carried in smaller bulk. It is cheaper to bring
iron ore to coal than coal to iron ore. If all three islands belong to
the same realm what will happen is quite clear. Island B will import
iron ore from Island A and will smelt it and turn it into pig-iron and
steel and iron manufactures of all kinds, while Island C, a long way
off, will remain unused. We will suppose the climate of No. C to be
bleak, the soil bad, and the people there, since they cannot sell their
iron ore on account of the distance at which they stand, make a very
poor livelihood out of grazing a few cattle.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the amount of iron ore imported every year by
No. B from No. A is worth £10 million. This of course has to be paid
for. In other words, Island No. B has got to export manufactured goods
in iron and steel back to Island No. A as payment for the iron ore which
No. B imports for smelting. It also has to pay for the freight on the
iron ore from No. A, that is, for the cost of bringing it over the sea
to No. B. Let us suppose this cost to be one million. The total value of
the iron goods produced on No. B, after being smelted with the coal of
No. B, is, let us say, £30 million. Of this, £11 million goes back for
the cost of carrying the ore from Island No. A and for its purchase.
Meanwhile we may neglect economic values of Island No. C, because the
few wretched inhabitants and their handful of cattle hardly count.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a wealth of £30,000,000 in manufactured iron
goods, of which £10,000,000 goes to Island No. A and £19,000,000 to
Island No. B, and £1 million to whoever carries the ore in ships. If you
were estimating the wealth of the whole realm made up of the three
islands, A, B and C, you would say: “The wealth of these people consists
in manufactured iron and steel goods. It is equivalent to £30,000,000 a
year, of which some £10,000,000 is revenue to Island A and £19,000,000
is revenue to Island B and £1 million earned in freights. The wealth of
Island C is negligible.” Well and good.</p>
<p>Now supposing the political conditions to change. Islands B and C
belong to one realm in future but Island A has become a foreigner. The
realm to which Islands B and C belong turns Protectionist and sets up a
barrier in the shape of a tariff against iron ore coming from abroad. We
have seen that the cost of carrying iron ore from No. A to No. B was
£1,000,000. No. C being much farther away from No. B, let us say that
the cost of carrying is £5,000,000, but it is carried by subjects of the
realm. The tariff put up by the realm to which Island B and C belong is
what is called “prohibitive”—that is, it is so high that it keeps the
iron ore of No. A out altogether, and the smelters on Island No. B are
bound to get their iron ore from that distant Island C. Let us see what
happens.</p>
<p>Island No. B has now got to pay a freight, that is, cost of bringing
the iron ore, five times as much as it used to be. Instead of paying
£11,000,000 for its ore (£10,000,000 at the mine and £1,000,000 for
carriage) it is now paying £15,000,000 (£10,000,000 at the mine and
£5,000,000 for carriage). It still makes £30,000,000 worth of goods a
year, but it only has £15,000,000 left over for its own income, instead
of the £19,000,000 which it used to have. It is thus impoverished.</p>
<p>But Island C, from having hardly any income at all, has now an income
of £10,000,000 a year. Island A is ruined. Protection has put the
getting of the ore under unnatural conditions. It has compelled the
coal-owners to go much farther off for their ore than they need have
done under Free Trade. The total wealth of all three islands altogether
is less than it used to be by £4,000,000, for they are adding £4,000,000
extra to the cost of getting the raw material. <em>But the total
combined wealth of B and C, even if they pay foreign ships to bring the
ore, is now greater than it used to be under the old Free Trade.</em>
No. B has £15,000,000; No. C has £10,000,000—the total is £25,000,000.
If they pay their own sailors to bring the ore it is £30,000,000. Under
the old conditions the total of B and C alone was only £19,000,000.
Island A is ruined and the total wealth of the whole system is less, but
the Protectionists of the realm, which now only includes B and C, are
quite indifferent to that. They are thinking of the wealth of their
common country, and are indifferent to the ruin of others, and their
policy is <em>increasing</em> the wealth of their common country at the
expense of foreigners.</p>
<p>In that example lies the argument for Protection. <em>If Island C
could do something other than mine ore, if it had other forms of wealth,
or by ingenuity or luck could discover some new fields in which its
activities might develop, then the argument for Protection in this case
would break down.</em> Island B would say: “Let me get my iron ore cheap
from the foreigner in Island A, and do you, on Island C, develop (let us
say) dairy farming, or something else which I cannot do and which Island
B cannot do. In that way we shall all three benefit, and the common
realm, consisting of Island B and Island C, will be richer than ever.
Island B will have all its old profit of £19,000,000 (instead of being
reduced to £15,000,000), and Island C can well develop a dairy produce
of more than £7,000,000.”</p>
<p>One ought to be able to see quite clearly from an example like this
how true it is that <em>the argument in favour of Protection applies to
particular cases only, and turns entirely upon whether an undeveloped
part of the energies of the community can be turned into new channels or
not.</em></p>
<p>We have’ an excellent, though small, example to hand in England
to-day. The English people have to send abroad about £4 worth of goods
every year per family for pig-meat, that is, bacon and hams and the
rest. There is no reason why they should do this. They could produce the
pigs on their own farms without drawing a single person from the
factories and keep this mass of manufactured goods for their own use.
The reason we are in this state in the matter of pig-meat is that our
agriculture has generally got into such a hole that people will not
bestir themselves to produce enough pigs. So here is a definite case in
point, and only experiment could show whether Protection would pay here
or would not pay.</p>
<p>Protection ought to take the form of saying:—</p>
<p>“Any pig-meat from abroad must pay such and such a sum per pound at
the ports as it enters.” This would raise the price of pig-meat in
England somewhat. If it raised the price to such an amount that the
English people as a whole had to pay £2 more a family, <em>and if at
that increased rate of price agricultural people could be stimulated
into feeding the right amount of pigs and taking the necessary trouble
to keep the supply going,</em> then the total wealth of the community
would be increased £2 per family. Even if the price had to increase till
each family on the average paid £3 more, or £3 10s. 0d. more, it would
still be of advantage to the nation <em>on condition that the higher
price really did make the farmers breed enough pigs, without lessening
their production of other things.</em> But if, when the charge on the
community had risen to £4 per family, it did not stimulate the
production of pigs in this country sufficiently to supply the market,
then your Protection of Pigs would be run at a loss.</p>

<section id="banking" class="level2">
<h2>Banking</h2>
<p>During the last two hundred and fifty years there has arisen, among
other modern economic institutions, the institution of
<em>Banking.</em></p>
<p>It has origins much older; indeed, people did something of the kind
at <em>all</em> times, but Banking as a fully developed institution grew
up in this comparatively short time: since the middle of the seventeenth
century. It began in Holland and England and spread to other
countries.</p>
<p>Like other modem institutions, it only became really important in the
latter half of this period, that is, during the last hundred years or
so; quite recently—in the last fifty years—it has become of such supreme
importance by the mastery it has got over the whole commonwealth that
everybody ought to try to understand its character. The Power of the
Banks comes to-day into the lives of all of us and largely affects the
relations between different nations. Indeed, it has become so powerful
quite lately that one of the principal things we have to watch in
politics is the enmity which the power of the Banks has aroused and the
way in which that power is being attacked.</p>
<p>The essential of banking lies in these two combined ideas: (1) that a
man will leave his money in custody of another man when that other man
has better opportunities for keeping it safe than he has; (2) that the
money so left in custody <em>may</em> be used by the custodian of the
money without the real owner being very anxious what is being done with
it, so long as he is certain to get it when he wants it.</p>
<p>The putting together of these two ideas—which are ideas naturally
arising in everybody’s mind—is the origin of all banking, and the moral
basis upon which banking reposes.</p>
<p>A man has £1,000 in gold. He has to travel or to go abroad on a war,
or is not certain of the safety of so large a sum if it is kept in his
house. He therefore gives it into the custody of a man whom he can
trust, and who, on account of special circumstances, can keep it more
securely than he himself can. What the owner of the £1,000 wants in the
transaction is to be certain of getting a part or the whole of his money
whenever he may need it. He does not want the individual pieces of
money. So long as he can get the value of them <em>or of part of
them</em> at any moment from the man to whom he gave custody of the
original sum he is satisfied.</p>
<p>A good many other people feel the same necessity. The man who has
special opportunities for looking after <em>all</em> their sums of money
collects them together and has them in his strong box in safe keeping.
Those who have acted thus would be very angry if they found their money
had been lost, or that when they came to ask for £20 or £100 out of
their thousand pounds—needing such a sum for the transactions of the
moment—the man in whose custody the whole lay was unable to let them
have the £20 or £100 required. But so long as the depositor (as he is
called, that is, the man who hands over his money for safe custody)
finds himself, in practice, always getting the whole or any part of his
deposit on demand, he is content; <em>and will not be annoyed to find
that the person in whose custody he left the money has been using it in
the meantime.</em></p>
<p>For instance: I might leave £1,000 in gold in the custody of someone
who is better able than I to prevent its being stolen. I am saved all
the trouble of looking after it, and I can call on a part of it or all
of it whenever I like. If there were only myself leaving it thus with
one friend, and it was a particular transaction between us two, that
friend would be acting wrongly if he were to take my £1,000 and buy a
ship with it, say, and do trade. No doubt he would earn a profit, and
could say to me when I came back for £100 of it: “I am sorry that I
cannot give you your £100, but I have used the money, without telling
you, to buy a ship. The ship will earn a profit of £200 at the end of
the year, and then you can have back your £100 if you like, and if you
press me, I will even sell the ship and you shall have back the whole of
your £1,000.”</p>
<p>In that case I should naturally answer: “No one gave you leave to use
my money. You have embezzled it, and you have acted like a thief.”</p>
<p>But when a very great number of men entrust their money in this
fashion, and do not specially stipulate that it should be left
untouched, when there is a sort of silent understanding that, if
whenever they want it, the money will be forthcoming, then they do not
ask too closely what has been done with the whole of the sum in the
custodian’s hands. For if <em>very many</em> people are thus “banking”
their money with one safe custodian only a certain proportion will
<em>at any one time</em> want their money, and the rest can be used
without danger of the “banker’s” failing to meet any particular demand.
Thus banking, that is, the use of other peoples’ money, arises and
becomes a natural process because it is of mutual advantage. The Banker
can earn profits with that average amount of money which always remains
in his hands, the depositors have their money safely looked after and
may even share in the profit.</p>
<p>A hundred men, let us say, have given £1,000 each into the hands of
such a custodian, who has come to be called their “Banker.” The total
sum of money in this man’s hands is £100,000. It is found in practice,
over the average of a number of years, that this hundred men do not
“draw” upon (that is, ask for their money to be paid out to them by)
their banker more than to the extent of, let us say, £100 every month
each, and it is also found that, while they need this £100 to pay wages
or bills or what not, they also come back with the money they earn (say,
£120 per month, on the average) and give it back to their banker for
safe keeping. In several years of this practice the banker discovers
that he must have about 100 times £100, that is £10,000, in free cash to
meet the demands upon him, and that he gets rather more put into his
custody in the same period of a month, year in and year out. It follows
that he always has about £90,000 in gold doing nothing the whole time.
He says to himself: “Why should I not use this money to buy instruments
of production—ships or ploughs, or machinery or what not—and produce
more wealth? It will not hurt those who have deposited it with me, for I
have found that, <em>on the average,</em> they never want more than a
tenth of their money out at the same time (and they are also perpetually
paying in more money to me—so that they and I are quite safe), and if I
make a good profit by the use of the things I shall have bought with
this £90,000 I can offer them part of the profit. So we are both
benefited.”</p>
<p>That is what the banker began by doing at the very origins of this
institution of banking. It was a little odd. It was not quite
straightforward. But the depositors, most of them, knew what was going
on, and at any rate did not protest. And if, when a profit was made out
of their combined money, they got some of that profit, they were glad
enough to see that their money had been put to some use and that they
had become richer by its use; while if they had kept it to themselves in
scattered small amounts it would not have made them any richer.</p>
<p>In England we can trace the origins of a great many banks, and of the
fortunes of their owners, proceeding along these lines. For instance:
there was a family of silversmiths rather more than two hundred years
ago. They had a shop in which silver objects were bought and sold, and
they also had gold plate to buy and sell. They had strong-boxes in which
these things were kept, and they paid money to men who guarded these
strong-boxes. It was a natural thing for people to go to this shop and
say: “I have here a thousand pounds in gold which is not very safe at
home. Will you look after it for me, on condition, of course that I may
call for any amount of it when I want it and what will you charge for
your trouble?” The silversmiths said: “Yes, we will do this, we will
charge nothing,” and in that way they got hold of very large sums which
people left with them. They found, as we have just seen, that in
practice, year after year, only a certain amount of the sums were
required of them at any one time, and rather than leave the big balance
lying idle they used it for buying useful things which would produce
more wealth. They lent the money sometimes to the State for its
purposes, that is, to the King of the time. Sometimes they employed it
in other ways which earned a profit. The people who left the money with
them always found that they could get back whatever they wanted when
they asked for it, and they were content. That is how banking arose.</p>
<p>Another example of which I know the history and which is very
interesting is that of a squire in the West of England who lived rather
less than two hundred years ago and has given his name to one of our
great banks still existing to-day. This squire was a rich man who had
many friends coming to his table. He had the reputation of good judgment
and his friends would say: “I will leave this sum of money in your
custody,” for they knew that he would be able to put it to good use and
give them part of the profit. Thus, looking after the money of
neighbours, he came to look after the money of a great many people whom
his neighbours recommended, and at last had hundreds of “clients,” as
the phrase went—that is, of people who would leave their money with him,
knowing that he would earn a profit both for himself and for them; at
the same time the money would be safely kept, and they might call for a
portion of it whenever they wanted it.</p>
<p>From such origins the banking system gradually extended until, about
a hundred years ago, or rather more, every rich family in this country
had a considerable sum of money left at a bank, and paid into the
banker’s coffers further sums of money which they received. Each had a
book of accounts with the bank showing exactly how much had been put in
and therefore how much they could “draw” upon. At first the clients, or
depositors, would “draw” some portion of their money which they might
immediately need by way of a letter. Thus, if their banker’s name was
Mr. Smith, they would write this note: “To Mr. Smith. Please pay my
servant who brings this letter £20 out of the £1,000 which I left with
you the other day.” They would sign this letter and send the servant
with it; the banker would give the £20 to the servant and the servant
would give a receipt against it.</p>
<p>That was the origin of what are nowadays called “cheques.” The letter
giving authority for the messenger to draw the money grew more and more
formal and was drawn up more and more in the same terms to save trouble.
Then the bankers would have the forms printed, so that the client who
wanted to draw would have the least possible trouble. If you look at a
cheque to-day you will see that it is nothing but the old letter put
into the simplest terms. At the head of the cheque is the name of the
bank; then there is the word ” Pay,” and after that the client adds the
sum which he wants paid and signs his name to prove that it is really he
who is entitled to have the sum and who is asking for it. The words ” or
bearer ” are sometimes printed after the word ” Pay,” so that anyone
bringing the cheque for the client can get the money for him.</p>
<p>But to prevent people using these pieces of paper to get money
without having the right to it the word “order” was more often
substituted for the word “bearer”; and this word “order” means that the
owner, who is drawing his money out, says: “Do not pay it to me; pay it
to this other person whom I desire to receive the money and whose name I
have mentioned above, who will sign to show that <em>his</em> order for
payment has been met.”</p>
<p>For instance: I have £1,000 deposited with my banker, Mr. Smith. I
write a letter: “Pay £20 to John Jones <em>or order.</em>” This
means:“Do not, dear Mr. Smith, send the money back to me, but give it to
Mr. Jones who will bring this letter with him, or, if he cannot come
himself, will send a signed letter <em>order</em> that it should be paid
to him.” At the beginning of the system, Mr. Jones, to whom I gave the
cheque, would write a little letter saying: “Dear Mr. Smith,
Mr. So-and-So, who banks with you, has given me the accompanying letter
by which I can get £20 of his <em>by my order.</em> I therefore send you
this letter to tell you that whoever brings this cheque bears my order
to give the money to him.” He signs the letter”John Jones” and the
banker hands over the money to whomever it may be that brings the letter
for John Jones.</p>
<p>In process of time the thing was simplified. In place of the letter
came the shortened form, the cheque, and you wrote: “Pay £20 to John
Jones or order,” and John Jones, instead of sending a letter signed by
himself, merely put his signature at the back of the cheque. This was
called “endorsement,” which is a Latin form of the English meaning
“putting one’s name on the back of anything.” A cheque “endorsed” with
the name “John Jones,” that is, with John Jones’s name signed on the
back of it, was paid by the bank to whomever John Jones might send to
receive the payment. My cheque asking for £20 to be paid to John J ones
having fulfilled its object, and the £20 being paid to whomever John
Jones had sent after he had “endorsed” that, cheque, the cheque was said
to have been “honoured” by the bank. The word “honoured” meant that the
bank had admitted that I had the money banked with them, and that they
were bound to hand it over on seeing my signature asking that it should
be handed over.</p>
<p>The convenience of cheques used in this way for business was obvious.
If I owed a man £20 and I had £1,000 with my banker, instead of having
to draw out twenty sovereigns myself and take them to him, all I had to
do was to write out a cheque to the order of this man, who would endorse
it and get the money.</p>
<p>Now as banking grew and came to deal with more and more people, it
was probable that this man, Jones, would have a banking account too with
somebody. If Mr. Smith was not his banker, then Mr. Brown would be. As
we have seen, people not only drew out money from the original sum they
had deposited at the bank, they also paid in money as they got it, on
account of the convenience of having it looked after safely. So when
John Jones got my cheque for £20, he often did not get the actual cash
from my banker, Mr. Smith, but simply gave in the cheque, endorsed by
him, to Mr. Brown, <em>his</em> banker, and said: “Get this from
Mr. Smith, the other banker, and add it to the sum which I have banked
with you, Mr. Brown.” The banker Brown did this, and the cheque which I
had originally signed in favour of John Jones, having gone the rounds,
was sent back to me to prove that the transaction was complete.</p>
<p>As banking continued to grow this system took on a vast extension.
Thousands and thousands of people paid, and were paid, by cheques, of
which only a small part were turned into cash, and of which much the
greater part were paid into the bankers’ offices and then settled by the
bankers among themselves.</p>
<p>After many years of this system it became apparent that the enormous
transactions, thousands of cheques all crossing each other daily in
hundreds of ways, could be simplified by the establishment of what came
to be called the ” Clearing House.”</p>
<p>Thus, suppose three bankers—Mr. Smith, Mr. Brown and Mr. Robinson. I
bank with Mr. Smith, and sign a cheque in favour of Mr. Jones who banks
with Mr. Brown, because I owe Jones a bill which I can thus pay. I also
sign a cheque in favour of Mr. Harding (that is, to the order of Mr.
Harding), to whom I also owe money. He banks with Mr. Robinson.
Meanwhile Harding perhaps owes money to Jones and pays him a cheque
ordering Mr. Robinson (Harding’s banker) to pay Jones a sum of money.
Jones hands this over to his banker, Mr. Brown. At the end of a certain
time—say, a month—the three bankers, Smith, Brown and Robinson, get
together and compare the various cheques they have received. It is
obvious that a great many will cancel out.</p>
<p>For instance: I have given Jones a cheque for £20 which Mr. Smith, my
banker, has to pay to Mr. Brown, Jones’s banker. But Mr. Brown has a
cheque of Mr. Harding’s asking Mr. Robinson to pay £20 to Jones, and
Jones has given that to Brown too. Meanwhile Jones has given me a cheque
later on, for something which he owed me, of £10. The bankers compare
notes and see that Smith need not pay £20 to Brown, and then ask Brown
for £10. It is simpler to pay the difference only. Mr. Smith hands to
Mr. Brown what is called the “balance.” The difference between £10 and
£20 is £10, and Brown hands over £10 to Smith. At the end of another
month perhaps it is Robinson, Harding’s banker, who finds that on
comparing notes he has a balance against him of £10 to Brown: and so
on.</p>
<p>When dozens of bankers came to be established with thousands of
clients, or “depositors,” the convenience of this system was
overwhelming. There would perhaps be in a week as many as 10,000 cheques
out, and instead of having to make 10,000 separate transactions of
paying from Brown to Smith, Smith to Robinson, Robinson back to Brown,
and so on, through dozens of bankers, the cheques were compared and only
the balances were paid over—or, as the phrase goes, “cleared.”</p>
<p>The Clearing House was the place where all the cheques of different
banks were put in at regular intervals and compared one with another, so
as to see what balances remained over, owing by particular bankers to
others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the banking system grew, most of the ready money in the
community came into the hands of the bankers. There was a perpetual
coming and going, and paying in and paying out, but there was always
among the bankers as a community a very large sum of money lying
untouched, a sort of reservoir. It was nearly always very much more than
two-thirds of the whole amount which the banks could be called on to
pay. That is, the depositors never wanted a third of their deposits out
at any one time. The art of a banker, therefore, consisted in knowing
how to purchase with this idle money left in their hands fruitful
objects for producing future wealth, in other words, “investing” it in
“capital enterprises,” but always prudently keeping a large reserve
ready to meet any demands which their depositors might suddenly make
upon them.</p>
<p>So far so good. The banking system up to this point in its
development was an advantage to the community and to individuals. It
enabled a large number of small sums which could not be used very well
separately to be collected together for big enterprises.</p>
<p>A thousand people, depositing a thousand pounds each, left a million
pounds in the hands of the bankers, of which much more than half a
million could be used at any time for ” development,” that is, for
buying instruments with which to develop natural resources. The nation
would be richer if a deep shaft were sunk and coal were got out of the
earth, but it would cost half a million to make that mine. No one of the
thousand small depositors could have undertaken such a task: the bank,
using all their monies together, could undertake it—and did so.</p>
<p>The banking system thus rapidly increased the wealth of the country,
and that was all to the good. People meanwhile felt their money to be
secure, and they had the great advantage of being able to draw cheques
for payments they had to make to those to whom they owed money, and of
receiving cheques for money due to them instead of perpetually handling
and carrying about large sums in metal—the whole passing through- the
bank and helping to keep this reservoir of wealth perpetually filled and
available for use in investment.</p>
<p>That state of affairs lasted to within the memory of men now living,
and, as I have said, the banking system during that time was an
advantage to everybody. There was nothing to be said against it.</p>
<p>But then came (as there comes upon every human institution after a
certain time) a further phase of development, in which the institution
of banking produced certain perils and evils. Those perils and evils are
increasing, and are producing the antagonism to the banks and to their
power which everybody is beginning to express to-day, all over Europe
and America, and which we must understand if we are to follow modern
political economy. I will show you how these evils in the Banking system
arose.</p>
<p>A man having £1,000 in the bank could draw upon it up to the total
amount. He could sign a cheque for £100 and then for £500 (making £600)
and then for another £400. Supposing he put nothing in during that time,
he would have exhausted the whole of what he had in his bank; he would
have come to an end of what is called, in the terms of banking, his
“balance.” There, you might think, was an end of his power to draw
cheques. He had got back all his money, so the bank and he had nothing
more to do with each other. At first, of course, that was the regular
state of affairs. A man could draw out all that he had in the bank, but
no more. It seems common sense.</p>
<p>But the banks had plenty of other people’s money lying about which
had not been drawn out, and much of which had not yet been invested in
capital enterprises, such as mining, or what not. They would say to the
man who had once put £1,000 into their hands and who had now drawn it
all out: “You still want to carry on your business; but you have
exhausted all the money you had with us. You will probably want to
borrow some money to tide you over until the time when further sums
begin to come in to you through what you sell in your business. We are
prepared to lend you money out of what we have to use from other
people’s deposits. You will pay a certain <em>‘interest’</em> upon it
(that is, so much a year on each hundred pounds we lend you—say £5 a
year for every £100), and you shall pay us back when you can.” The bank
accompanied this offer with the right to draw further cheques to, say,
another thousand pounds, which the bank would”honour”—that is, for which
the bank would pay out money which did not really belong to their client
but was lent to him by the bank out of other people’s balances. And this
extra amount, which the bank thus allowed their client over and beyond
what was his own money was, and is, called an “over-draft.”</p>
<p>At first, before the banks would allow anybody an “over-draft” (that
is, a loan), they required the borrower to give security. He had to
leave with them gold or silver plate or a mortgage upon his land, so
that if, in the long run, he found himself unable to pay back, the
banker, could sell the security and recoup himself.</p>
<p>But it was obviously convenient and useful when a client was in a big
way of business to grant him an “over-draft” from time to time although
he had no security to offer. The bank said to itself: “Here is a
merchant making very large profits every year. It takes him some time to
get his money in from the foreigners to whom he sells goods oversea, but
he is bound to get it sooner or later. So, without asking him for any
security (for perhaps he has no plate or title deeds or what not to
give), it is still well worth our while to let him have an over-draft
(that is, a loan) out of the other people’s money. He will pay us
interest upon it, we shall make a profit, and when the foreigners pay
him he will be able to pay us back.”</p>
<p>In this way the banks became on all sides lenders of money to persons
without security, and it became exceedingly important to any trader
whether he could or could not get the banks to back him up in this
fashion.</p>
<p>The thing went farther. A man might have no capital at all, but a
good idea. He might have discovered, for instance, a mine of copper-ore
in some colony. He would come to the banks and say: “I have not the
money to pay labourers to dig for this ore, but if you will advance the
money to me and go shares in the profit the ore can be got out.” The
banks would look at the “proposition,” as it is called, and if they
thought it a good thing they would advance the money and share the
subsequent profits with the borrower. All over the world the banks were
thus “financing,” as it is called, every kind of enterprise.</p>
<p>The system went farther still—and here it is that we come upon the
modern trouble. Hitherto when they gave an over-draft to anybody,
whether with or without security, or even when they gave a loan to a man
who had no capital at all, and “backed” him in his enterprise which they
thought likely to prove successful, they had used the money which other
clients had left with them. But it occurred to the banks after a certain
time that there was no need to use anybody else’s money at all. <em>They
could themselves offer to honour the cheques of the man to whom they
lent the money, without having any real money with which to pay those
cheques.</em></p>
<p>Why was this? It was because, with the growth of the banking system,
hardly any of the payments were, by this time, actually made in gold.
Real money only passed in a very small degree. Of the myriad
transactions all but a tiny proportion were <em>“instruments of
credit.”</em> Just as a bank-note issued by the Bank of England is a
promise to pay in gold, and yet a promise to pay a million pounds in
bank-notes could always be made with much less than a million real
pounds to redeem the notes so <em>the hanks could create paper money, or
its equivalent, in the form of over-drafts.</em> If they said to a man
who had no money deposited with them: “We will honour your cheques up to
£1,000” <em>what they were really doing was increasing the paper
currency to the extent of £1,000.</em> They were issuing promises to
pay, exactly like banknotes, knowing that of the total amount out only a
small proportion at any moment would be required in real money.</p>
<p>There was a check on this system of creating new artificial paper
money by the banks (for this is what it came to), and the check
consisted in the control of the Government over the National Bank—in
England the Bank of England. There was a law preventing the Bank of
England from issuing more than a certain number of notes in proportion
to the gold lying behind them, and the private banks could not issue
over-drafts, or loans, indefinitely, because they could not get more
than a certain amount of paper money from the Bank of England to meet
the payments they had to make, and the Bank, in its turn, could not
issue more than a certain proportion of paper money against its
gold.</p>
<p>So ultimately the amount of real money, the gold, in the hands of the
banks, both national and private, acted as a check upon this creation of
false money by the banks. But when gold payments ceased with the Great
War that check broke down, and even if gold payments had not ceased, the
power of the banks thus to “create” as it is called,—in other words,
their power to say to any individual enterprise: “You shall or you shall
not have your cheques honoured: you shall or you shall not carry
on”—gave them an immense and increasing power over the community.</p>
<p>That is why the revolt against the banking system and its control
over our lives in the modern state since the war is becoming so
formidable.</p>
<p>It has two chief forms against which men protest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The bankers can decide, of two competitors, which shall survive.
As the great majority of enterprises lie in debt to the banks—that is,
carrying on with loans allowed them by the banks working with money
<em>made</em> by the banks—any one of two competing industries can be
killed by the bankers saying: “I will no longer lend you this money. I
‘call it in’—that is, ask for it to be paid at once. But I will not
exercise the same pressure upon the man who is competing against you.”
This power makes the banks the masters of the greater part of modem
industry. It is argued that the banks do not act from caprice, and will
naturally only back a sound enterprise and only ruin an unsound one.
That is, on the whole, true. But still, those who command them have the
power, if they like, to act from caprice, and whenever you give a few
human beings great power of this sort over millions of others it tends
to be abused.</p></li>
<li><p>The banks, especially in England, are all in one combination and
keep detailed information upon all of us. Not only have they control
over industry through their power to make or withhold the money which
they alone can now create and hand out to those they favour, but they
also keep indexes of detailed information as thorough and widespread as
those of any Government office. They have a secret service more
widespread and powerful than that of the State, and this hidden power of
theirs, though private and concealed knowledge, irritates plain men more
and more. People feel that they are not free, and that the banking
system, which is international in essence, is a universal and hidden
master.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore all over the world to-day people are saying: “The banking
system, and the few men who direct it, are altogether too powerful. They
control our lives. They are beginning to control the public policy of
the State, especially in England, and there ought to be a national
authority superior to them and keeping them in order.”</p>
<p>A great many schemes have lately been on all sides proposed to
establish such a superior authority. Thus, we have in England a very
powerful movement in favour of what is called the ” Douglas Scheme of
Credit,” and of course the Socialists, with their ideas of State control
of everything, would also put an end to the private power of the banking
system. Then there are those who want to have a strong King who would be
able to override any lesser power in the State, including the
bankers.But the points to seize in understanding the political economy
of our time are those I have just been describing to you: what the
banking system is, how it arose, how unnaturally powerful it has become,
and why a universal revolt is arising against it.</p>
<p>There will be a struggle inevitably between the banking, or
financial, interest and the people all over civilised countries: but no
one can tell which will win. In industrial countries the odds are in
favour of the banks, or financiers. In peasant countries against
them.</p>

<section id="national-loans-and-taxation" class="level2">
<h2>National Loans and Taxation</h2>
<p>Every country must, to carry on its national services, raise taxes
from its citizens, and those taxes, though levied in money, translate
themselves, of course, into goods, that is, economic values attached to
material objects.</p>
<p>We say that the State “raises,” say, a hundred million pounds in
taxation from its citizens a year, for “State Purposes”; and when you
come to look into what is actually got by the State and how the State
uses what it has got, it means that the State levies so many boots and
so much bread, and so much housing material and so much clothing, and
spends this again in maintaining State servants, that is, in clothing
and housing and feeding soldiers and policemen, and civil servants and
school teachers, and so on.</p>
<p>But in the modern world, and for the last two hundred years or so,
nearly all states have also had to raise taxation <em>in order to pay
interest upon the State loans.</em></p>
<p>A State loan, or <em>national debt,</em> arises in this way. The
State needs a great quantity of goods for a particular purpose—usually
for the very unproductive purpose of waging a war. It has to get a lot
of metal for its munitions and guns, and quantities of food to feed the
soldiers, and coal to transport them. Now there are two ways in which a
state gets these. The first is to get the whole amount, as it is needed,
directly from the people, by a very heavy tax levied at the time. That
was what was done for hundreds of years before the second method was
attempted. The king of a country, wishing to wage war, would ask his
subjects for contributions, and he could not wage war upon a scale more
than these contributions would meet.</p>
<p>But about two hundred years ago there began (and since then has very
largely increased), the second method, which is that of <em>national
loans.</em></p>
<p>The State is, let us say, taking in ordinary taxation from its
citizens about one-tenth of their produce. Suddenly it finds itself
involved in a much higher expenditure, amounting to, say, half the
produce of the country. If it asked for half the produce right away as a
tax people might refuse to pay it, or it might make the policy of the
State—the war, for instance, which the Government wanted to wage—so
unpopular that the State could not pursue that policy or wage that war.
So the Government had recourse to <em>borrowing</em> from the citizens,
promising to pay, to those who lent, interest in proportion to what they
borrowed, as well as the capital itself. Thus they would <em>take</em>
in taxation for a war money from a farmer equivalent to <em>ten</em>
loads of wheat; but they would also <em>borrow</em> from him <em>one
hundred loads</em> of wheat, promising to give him as interest
<em>five</em> loads of wheat every year for any number of years until
they should ultimately pay back the whole hundred loads as well.</p>
<p>When these national loans began the Governments honestly intended to
pay back what they borrowed. But the method was so fatally easy that, as
time went on, the debt piled up and up until there could be no question
of repaying it: all the State could do was to pay the interest out of
taxation. It remained indebted to private rich men for the principal,
that is, the whole original sum, and meanwhile, through further wars,
this hold of the rich men upon all the rest of the community perpetually
increased</p>
<p>The “National Debt”—as it came to be called—remained a permanent
institution, in connection with which all the citizens had to be taxed
in order to provide interest for the rich lenders. Latterly these
burdens of national debt have become overwhelming, and at the present
moment about a twelfth of everything that English people produce is
taken from them and handed over as interest to the comparatively few
wealthy residents in England and abroad who lent great sums to the
Government during the war.</p>
<p>It is true that whenever a loan is raised the Government provides not
only interest but what is called a “sinking fund”—that is, an extra
amount of taxation every year which is dedicated to paying back the
whole of the loan slowly. But long before a loan is paid off some new
occasion arises compelling the Government to borrow again on a large
scale, and the total debt perpetually increases.</p>
<p>The result is that all the great modem European nations are now
loaded with a debt really larger than any of them can bear, and that
therefore they have all taken steps to lighten that burden by various
tricks not at all straightforward. Some of them pay back in money which
appears the same as the money which they borrowed, but which has a very
different value. They have borrowed for a war, say, £1,000, representing
100 tons of wheat. Then they debase the currency, so that a sum still
called £1,000 will only buy 20 tons of wheat, and in this way they can
pretend to pay the lender back, although they are really cheating him of
four-fifths of what he lent. Two countries, Germany and Russia, have
pushed this so far that the lenders are now not really paid anything at
all. A man who lent the German Government, for carrying on the war,
money which during the war would have bought a million tons of wheat, is
now (October, 1923) paid back in money called by the same name but able
only to purchase a tenth of a ton—which is the same as saying that he is
not paid back at all.</p>
<p>Of all European countries that fought in the war our own has been the
most honest in this matter, but even in England a man who lent the
equivalent of 1,000 sheep, say, and who was promised interest at the
rate of 50 sheep a year, is only getting 25 sheep a year on account of
the change in the value of money.</p>
<p>In this matter of loans we must distinguish between <em>internal
loans</em> and <em>external loans.</em> An internal loan is borrowed
from one’s own people. It involves taxing and impoverishing one set of
citizens in order to pay interest to and enrich another set. But the
country as a whole is no poorer. An <em>external</em> loan is borrowed
from foreigners, and the interest on it is dead loss to the country.
Also, it cannot be paid in debased currency. A government can cheat its
own nationals by paying them in false money. But it has to pay foreign
lenders in real money. A foreign loan is real. It must be (as a rule)
paid in gold. England thus pays millions a year to America.</p>
<p>Now from State <em>loans</em> let us turn to State <em>taxation,</em>
which has to-day for its most permanent object the payment of interest
on internal and external loans.</p>
<p>How does the State tax its citizens?</p>
<p>Taxation levied by the State is divided into two kinds—called
<em>direct</em> and <em>indirect.</em></p>
<p>Direct taxation is the taxation levied upon the money which the
person who pays it has at his disposal.</p>
<p>For instance: If you have £1,000 a year and the State makes you
declare that and then taxes you £100 every year, that is direct
taxation.</p>
<p>Indirect taxation takes the form of levying a tax on the manufacturer
of an article or on the importer of an article, which tax he passes on
to the person who consumes it, by an addition to the price of the
article. Thus, when you buy a pound of tea or a bottle of wine you are
paying indirect taxation. The price which you paid for the tea is so
much for the real value of the tea and so much more (though you do not
feel or know it at the time) which has been paid on the tea as it came
into England at the ports. The brewers who make beer have got to pay the
Government so much for every gallon they make, and this is passed on to
the people who buy the beer by an extra amount put on to the price.</p>
<p>The wisest men who have discussed how taxes should be levied laid
down four rules which, unfortunately, no Government has kept to as it
should. It is worth while knowing those rules, because they are a guide
to what good taxation should be.</p>
<p>These rules are:—</p>
<p>1. A tax should fall in such a fashion that it is paid most
easily.</p>
<p>For instance: it is much easier to pay £100 a year in small sums
which fall due at frequent intervals than to pay the whole £100 upon
demand in one lump.</p>
<p>2. The tax should be so arranged that the cost of collecting it
should be as slight as possible.</p>
<p>For instance: if I put a tax upon everyone who crosses a particular
bridge, I shall have to appoint and pay someone to collect the tax at
the bridge, and I shall probably have to pay inspectors to go round and
see that these bridgemen do their duty and do not cheat. If I tried to
levy a tax of this kind on a great many bridges that are not much used
the cost of collecting would be very high compared with the revenue
produced. But if I put a tax on every cheque issued by a bank,
<em>that</em> tax is collected with hardly any expense. All the
Government has to do is to say that no cheque will be valid unless it
carries a stamp. The banks stamp all their cheques with this stamp, and
when they sell a cheque book to a customer they take the value of the
stamps from him. All the Government has to do is to find out the number
of cheque books issued, and ask for the money from the banks.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

England about a lifetime ago.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>3. Taxes are better in proportion as they fall on unnecessary things
rather than on necessary things.</p>
<p>It is much better, obviously, to make people pay for their luxuries
than for their necessities. It is oppressive to make people pay for
their necessities, which even the very poor must have, and it is juster
and altogether better to make people pay for things which they need not
have. Thus, when the tax was first levied upon tea it was a tax upon a
luxury, for only rich people then drank tea. But to-day, when the
poorest people must drink it, it is unjust to tax it, for it is a
necessity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to keep to this rule in any modem
country, because the amount of taxes required is so large that unless
one taxes the necessities one will not get enough money for the
requirements of the State: thus tea and sugar, beer and tobacco, all of
them <em>necessities</em> of the poorest people, are enormously taxed.
Our poor people in England are much more heavily taxed than any people
in the world.</p>
<p>4. Taxes should fall proportionately to the wealth of the taxed, that
is, the sacrifice should be equally felt by all. This rule is easy
enough to keep when taxation is light. For a very slight tax on poor
men—who are the vast majority of the State, suffices to bring in the
small revenue needed, and a severe tax on rich men is but an addition.
But when taxation must be heavy to meet the requirements of the
State—say more than a twentieth of poor men’s incomes—then the rule is
difficult to keep. For either you get insufficient revenue if you spare
the poor, or you must tax the poor on a scale which no increase of the
taxation on the rich can really equal. When taxation is too heavy, you
must either ruin the rich or crush the poor. And that is why heavy
taxation has destroyed so many States.</p>
<p>5. The last rule about taxation is that it should be
<em>certain;</em> and this means that the State should be certain of
getting what it ought to get, and that the people who pay should know
what they have to pay and not be left in doubt and anxiety.</p>
<p>For instance: the tax on tobacco in this country is a certain tax. It
is levied on a comparatively small number of ships’ cargoes which enter
the country with tobacco, because we do not grow tobacco in England, and
the sum which the importers pay is automatically passed on to the
purchasers. The State knows by experience how much tobacco the people
will buy in the country in the year, and the people who buy tobacco know
what they mean to spend, and can, if they choose, ascertain how much of
this goes in taxation. But the same tax on tobacco in France is not a
certain tax, because the French grow a lot of their own tobacco—in fact,
most of it. The people who grow tobacco naturally try to hide the total
amount of their crop from the Government inspectors, and a great number
of these inspectors have to be going about the whole time actually
counting each leaf on each plant and rummaging in the bins to see that
none is gone.</p>
<p>An example of a most uncertain and unjust tax for the taxpayer in our
own country is the Income Tax, because it is difficult to prevent
unfixed people from hiding their profits or from concealing from the tax
collectors amounts which they have earned. Also the honest citizen with
an established and known position can be bled to the full, while the
rogue and adventurer, the speculator and dealer escapes. But it is a
certain tax from the point of view of the Government, because they know
on the average what a penny on the Income Tax will produce one year with
another, and are not concerned with justice but with a calculable
revenue.</p>
<p>Before we leave this discussion it is worth while mentioning an odd
idea which a few very earnest and active people have got hold of, called
the “Single Tax.”</p>
<p>It is really much more a part of the theory of Socialism than a
system of taxation. Still, as it has come to be called the “Single Tax”
we will treat it under that head.</p>
<p>The idea of the single tax is this:—Rent, or the surplus value of a
site, whether it be due to the extra fertility of farm land or to the
extra convenience of town land, is, say the Single Taxers, not the
product of the individual who owns the land.</p>
<p>If I own a barren piece of heath on which I cannot get any rent for
agriculture, and then a railway is built passing through it and a
station is built on the heath, many town workers who want to live in the
country will take houses which will be built near this station and live
in these houses, running up and down from town for their work. In a few
years this barren heath which brought me in nothing will be bringing in
many thousands a year, for a little town will have sprang up, and I
shall be able to charge rent to all the people who live there upon my
land.</p>
<p>The Single Taxers say that, since I did nothing towards making the
extra value, but that extra value has been made by the growth of
population and by the activity of the whole community, I have no right
to these rents. In the same way they say that I have no right to the
rent of a very fertile field compared with a bad field which pays little
or no rent, because it was not I that made the soil fertile.</p>
<p>So they propose that <em>all the rents of the country should be
levied as a tax.</em> They say that no other taxes are needed. If I have
money from dividends in an industrial concern I can keep all that
without paying any taxes on it, and I can be let off taxes on tobacco
and drink and everything else of that sort. But anything I get as rent
for land I must pay over to the State. I may still be allowed to call
myself the owner of the land, but I must be taxed an equivalent to the
rent which it produces.</p>
<p>These people have never been able to apply their theory, and the
reason is pretty clear. It would work most unjustly, considering that
people buy and sell land just as they do any other commodity, and that a
man who had put all his money into rents in land would be ruined by this
system, while another man with exactly the same amount of money, who had
put it into a business, would go scot free. If you were starting a new
country it might be possible to begin with the Single Tax system, but
even then you would be up against the fact that people like owning land
because such ownership gives them independence. But at any rate it is
theoretically possible to apply this system in a new country. In an old
country it is quite out of the question.</p>

<section id="the-social-or-historical-value-of-money" class="level2">
<h2>The Social (or Historical) Value of Money</h2>
<p>There is a special point in Economics which has been very little
dealt with, or rather not properly dealt with at all, and which you will
find interesting as a new piece of study, because it will help you to
understand history as nothing else will: and that point is the
<em>Social</em> (<em>or Historical</em>) <em>Value of Money.</em></p>
<p>You read how, in the past, the King of England, wishing to wage a
great war, managed to raise, say, a hundred thousand pounds; and how
that was thought a most enormous sum: whereas to-day, for the same sized
army, we should need thirty times as much. You read how Henry VIII
suppressed the Monastery at Westminster which had an income of four
thousand pounds a year, and how this income was then regarded as
something very large indeed—much as we to-day regard a half million a
year or more—the income of some great shipping company. You read how the
National Debt later on actually reached <em>one</em> million, and people
trembled lest the State could not bear the burden.</p>
<p>Yet here we are to-day, raising hundreds of millions yearly in
taxation, spending thousands of millions in our wars.</p>
<p>What is the explanation of this apparently totally different meaning
of money in different times? It puzzles nearly everybody who reads
history intelligently, and it wants explanation. Most attempts to
explain it have failed, or have been very insufficient; some of them
quite vague, as: “The value of money was very different in those days
from what it is now.” Or: “Money was then at least ten times as valuable
as now” (whereas it is clear from the chronicle that it was
<em>enormously</em> more valuable!) Sentences like that leave the
unfortunate reader as much in the dark as he was before. We need a more
precise explanation, and that I think can be given.</p>
<p>There are three things which, between them, decide the social value
of money at any period, and unless we consider <em>all</em> three we
shall go wrong. The reason why most people have gone wrong in trying to
solve the problem—or have abandoned it—is that they only consider the
first of the three. These three things are as follows:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>The actual purchasing power of whatever is used as
currency</em>—in our case, for nearly the whole of European history,
gold: the amount of wheat and leather and building materials and all the
rest of it, which so much weight of gold (say an ounce) will purchase at
any time. This varies in different periods according to the amount of
gold present in circulation, and its efficiency in circulation. We saw
how these were the factors of price, that is, of the purchasing power of
money, when we spoke of money earlier in the book.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The number of kinds of things</em> which money can be used to
buy in any society—or, to put it in learned words, “the number of
categories of purchasable economic values.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>The economic scale of the community,</em> that is, the number
of its citizens and the amount of its total wealth at a given
time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When we go into the full meaning of all these three things we shall
see how, in combination, they make up the social value of money at any
time, and why that value differs so very much between one historical
period and another.</p>
<section id="the-actual-purchasing-power-of-the-currency" class="level3">
<h3>1. The actual purchasing power of the currency</h3>
<p>Given the same currency (and in Western Europe it has, for all
practical purposes, been gold for the last two thousand years), we can
measure the purchasing value of such and such a weight of gold in any
period by what is known as the <em>Index Number</em> of that period.</p>
<p>The Index Number is a thing important to understand, because it comes
into a great deal of modern discussion as well as historical discussion;
for instance: wages are nowadays largely based upon an Index Number.</p>
<p>A particular year is taken, say the year 1900, and the records of
what various commodities were fetching in gold in the market during that
year are examined. Thus it is found that an ounce of gold in that year
would buy (let us say) four hundred pounds weight of wheat, 600 pounds
weight of barley, 80 pounds weight of bacon, 80 gallons of beer, a
quarter of a ton of pig iron, and so on. A list is drawn up of all the
principal commodities which are used in the community. Suppose that 100
such commodities are taken and between them make up by far the great
part—say seven-eighths—of all the values commonly consumed in that
community. The next thing to do is what is called to “weight” each
commodity, for it is evident that a commodity which is very largely
bought—such as bread—must count more in estimating the purchasing power
of money than a commodity of which very much less is used—such as
tin.</p>
<p>According to the value of each commodity used in any one period of
time (say a year) the various commodities are “weighted.” Thus you count
bread (let us say) as twelve times more important than lead, because the
value of the bread used in the community for one year is twelve times as
much as the value of the lead used in the community during that year.
Then let us suppose that the value of the leather used is three times
that of the lead, the value of the iron five times, etc. You put against
each commodity these “weight” numbers.</p>
<p>Next you find out what an ounce of gold would purchase of each of
those commodities in that particular year. For instance: you find it
would purchase a quarter of a ton of lead, 400 pounds weight of bread,
and so on, only you multiply by your weight number the use of gold in
each particular article. For instance: you count the gold used in buying
bread as twelve times more important than the gold used in buying
lead.</p>
<p>You then add up all the prices measured in an ounce of gold in your
column; you divide by the number of items in your column, each
multiplied by its weight number, and the result is that your ounce of
gold for the year 1900 will be found to have a certain <em>average
purchasing power</em> which you call, for the sake of further
application, arbitrarily,</p>
<p>Then you take another year, say 1920, and you find what the ounce of
gold would purchase in the same conditions, similarly weighted, in the
year 1920. You discover that the ounce of gold on the average in 1920
would only purchase half the weight of stuff it purchased in 1900. In
other words, prices have doubled, or, what is the same thing, gold has
halved in value. You put down for the year 1920 the figure “200,” which
means that average prices are twice as great as they were in 1900, and
the economist’s way of saying this is: “With the year 1900 as a base,
the Index Number for 1920 is 200.”</p>
<p>In the year 1921 he makes the calculation again, and finds that
prices have fallen, that is, gold has become rather more valuable as
compared with other things, and prices are only three-quarters more than
they were in 1900. The economist writes down: “The Index Number for 1921
is 175, with the prices of 1900 as a base.” He goes back to 1880 and
finds that in 1880, after making a similar calculation, an ounce of gold
would on the average buy five pounds of material where in 1900 it could
only buy four. In other words, prices are lower in 1880 by one-fourth.
So he writes down: “The Index Number for 1880, with 1900 as a base, is
75.”</p>
<p>These Index Numbers taken for each year with a particular year as a
<em>base,</em> or year of reference, show the fluctuations in the
purchasing value of gold.</p>
<p>To make the process clearer, we will take a simple instance and
imagine a community in which there were only three things purchased on a
large scale by the citizens—wheat, bacon, and iron. We take for our year
of reference, let us say, the year 1880, and we find that an ounce of
gold would purchase one ton of wheat, half a ton of iron, and a quarter
of a ton of bacon. But the amount spent on wheat was ten times the
amount spent on bacon and twenty times the amount spent on iron.</p>
<p>You add up the twenty tons of wheat, the half ton of iron and the
half ton of bacon—half a ton of the latter because twice as much is
spent on it as is spent on iron, and therefore though it is half the
price of iron you must double the amount, because twice as much is
bought.</p>
<p>You get 21 tons. To buy this 21 tons of stuff 3 ounces of gold were
needed. You divide the 21 tons by 3, and you get 7 tons of material on
the average.</p>
<p>Next, as you are taking this particular year for a “base” (or year of
reference) you call the 7 “100,” so that you may compare in percentages
the rise or fall of prices in other years. You then do exactly the same
thing with these three staple commodities in another year—say 1890—and
you find that your ounce of gold purchases no longer 7 tons of stuff,
but 14 tons of stuff. Taking the year 1800 as your base number, you will
see that the Index Number for 1890 is “50.”</p>
<p>Then you do the same thing for the year 1920, and you find that with
the same ounce of gold you can only purchase 3½ tons of stuff. 7 is to
3½ as 100 is to 200, so the Index Number for 1920 will be 200 as
compared with the base year—or year of reference—which is 1880.</p>
<p>You cannot use the Index Numbers without knowing what your base year
is and what average prices were in that base year, but, having settled
that, your Index Number is nothing more than a statement of <em>average
prices,</em> or again, the average purchasing power of a fixed weight of
gold in the various epochs you examine.</p>
<p>In reality the calculating of an Index Number involves a great many
more difficult points than these, and of course the number of
commodities taken is very much more than three; but that is the method
in its general outline, and if you go over it carefully I think you will
not find it difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The first thing, then, in finding out the social value of money at
any historical period is to find out the purchasing value of a given
weight of gold—say, one ounce. Supposing we are comparing the time when
Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries and took their wealth (1536-9) with
our own time, before the War, when our currency was still normal and in
gold, you will find that with 100 as your base for prices in 1536-9 the
Index Number of 1913 is, according to different calculations, somewhere
between 2,000 and 2,400. I have gone into it myself very carefully, and
I make it out to be at least 2,400 (though historians some time ago, who
had not gone into it very fully, used to make it lower); that is, where
one ounce of gold would purchase the things which Englishmen regarded as
their staple commodities in 1536, 24 ounces of gold would be necessary
to-day.</p>
<p>That is the first thing you have to consider when you are comparing
the social value of money at that time with the social value of money in
our own time. You multiply right away by 24. You hear, for instance,
that a man had £100 a year paid him by the King for looking after the
garrison at Dover. You translate it into modern money, and say that he
had £2,400 a year paid him <em>in our money.</em></p>
<p>Most people stop there, and that is why they get their answer to the
problem all wrong. In reality the <em>social</em> value of money then
was <em>very much more than</em> 24 times what it is now, and £100 a
year under Henry VIII meant <em>a great deal more</em> than what £2,400
means now.</p>
<p>In order to see how true this is we have to consider the next two
points which I mentioned.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-number-of-purchasable-categories" class="level3">
<h3>2. The number of purchasable categories</h3>
<p>Suppose you put a man into a little primitive place like Andorra
(which is a tiny independent state shut off from the world in a valley
of the Pyrenees), and he is paid there £1,000 a year. He cannot live in
a house with more than a small rental, because there are no big houses
to be had. Everybody lives in simple, little houses. He cannot spend his
money on many things. There are no roads, no use for a motor car; no
railways, so he cannot spend money on railway fares; no theatres or
cinematographs—none of the hundred things which we have here on every
side. He can buy bread and meat, and wine and clothing, and very little
else—for there is nothing else to be bought. In other words, the number
of <em>sets of things</em> (that is what the word “categories”
means—“sets of things”) on which he can spend money is a great deal less
than what it would be in London. A man with £1,000 a year in London and
a family to keep is, of course, very much better off than a labouring
man, but still he is not rich, as rich people use the term. He will live
in a house for which he must pay perhaps £200 a year, counting rent and
taxes. Then he will—he usually must—travel, and that will cost him
perhaps £50 a year. Then his friends will expect to meet him and he must
have them at his house, and he will have to spend a good deal in postage
and telegraphing—and so on. The man in Andorra with £1,000 a year simply
would not know what to do with it. He would be so “well off” that he
would have a very large surplus—more than half—to give away, or to help
other people with, or to save and invest. But exactly the same sort of
man, with the same ideas and bringing-up and necessities, put down in
London would certainly not be able to save a penny of his £1,000 a
year.</p>
<p>So we see that the social value of £1,000 a year in Andorra is very
different from the social value of the same sum in London. Some people
might be inclined to laugh at this difference, and to say: “Oh, yes! but
the man in London could, if he liked, save, simply by not spending on
those various categories, as you call them.” Yes; he as an individual
might choose to live an odd life of his own and not do what other people
do. But <em>Society as a whole</em>—that is, all the community round
him—in London is, as a fact, spending upon those various, very numerous,
categories, while in Andorra he does not, for he <em>cannot,</em> spend
upon them; they are not there to be purchased. Therefore it is true that
the <em>social value</em> of the same sum, with the same index number,
is on the average very much higher in Andorra than in London.</p>
<p>You cannot give this difference precisely in figures as you can an
index number, because nobody can precisely calculate the number of
categories nor the respective importance of each, but the least
knowledge of history shows you that in Henry VIII’s time, in 1536, the
number of categories was very much smaller than it is to-day. So the man
to whom Henry VIII paid £100 a year as salary for looking after one of
his castles, though the purchasing value of his income—the amount of rye
or pork or what not that he could buy with it—was what we should call
to-day £2,400 a year, had a much higher income <em>relatively to the
people of the time</em> than has a man with £2,400 a year to-day. He
counted much more than a man to-day counts who has five thousand a
year.</p>
<p>But this second point is not all. There is again a third point, as we
have seen, and we must next turn to that.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-purchasing-value-of-the-whole-community" class="level3">
<h3>3. The purchasing value of the whole community</h3>
<p>The third factor in the making up of the social value of money is the
relation of any sum to the total wealth of the whole community. That of
course depends upon two things: the average of wealth of each family in
the community, and the number of those families.</p>
<p>Supposing, for instance, with things at their present prices, you
consider two communities: (1) the people of Iceland, (2) the people of
Australia. In both countries you can get pretty much the same amount of
stuff for an ounce of gold, and though there are less categories of
purchasable things in Iceland than in Australia, yet most of the things
a civilised man requires can be got in Iceland—at least in the capital,
or can be imported there by the inhabitants if they need them or can
afford to pay for them. Both communities are of our own race and of much
the same standard of culture and the same idea of how one should live.
But Iceland has only four thousand families, and these families are poor
for the most part. Australia has a million families, that is, 250 times
as many, and they are much richer than the families in Iceland on the
average. There are much worse differences of rich and poor in Australia
than there are in Iceland. There are far more miserable and starving
people in Australia than there are in Iceland; but the <em>average</em>
wealth of a family in Australia is much higher than that in Iceland.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the Government of Iceland were to want to build a
new harbour for the capital, which is on the sea, and in order to get
the money were either to confiscate the wealth of certain rich people or
to tax all the people—supposing it wanted, for instance, £400,000 in
order to complete the work. And supposing the people of Australia
similarly wanted to build a harbour and also wanted £400,000 to be got
in the same way. The index number is the same in both places. An ounce
of gold will roughly purchase the same amount of things in both places,
for the index number at any moment is much the same all over the white
world, measured in gold, and we may imagine the categories of
purchasable things to be much the same in both places. Yet the social
value of the £400,000 is quite different in Iceland from what it is in
Australia. In Iceland it means taking an average of £100 from each of
the poor families—if you get it by taxation—or the confiscation of all
the wealth of the very few rich men there may be. But in Australia it
means no more than the taking of about 8s. from each family, and that
from an average family income much higher than the average family income
in Iceland. Under this heading the social value of £400,000 in Iceland
is enormous and in Australia is small. If Iceland tried to build such a
harbour it could hardly do so. The economic effort would be very great,
and if it succeeded it would fill a big place in the history of the
island. In Australian history it would pass almost unnoticed.</p>
<p>Now let us add the influence of all these three points together, and
we shall see that there is a vast difference between the social value of
money in the time of Henry VIII, when the monasteries were dissolved,
and the social value of the same amount of money to-day. We shall see,
for instance, why the King, taking away the annual revenues of the
Monastery of Westminster and keeping them for himself, made such a
prodigious splash, although the actual amount in pounds, or weight of
gold, in which the income of Westminster Abbey could then be measured
was only £4,000 a year. In the first place, you must multiply by 24, so
that the actual income or annual purchasing value in wheat, beef, rye,
pork, beer, which was confiscated, was nearly £100,000 in our money.
Then you must remember that it took place in a community where there was
a very much smaller number of purchasable categories; that is, where
people had a very much small number of “sets of things” upon which to
spend money.</p>
<p>And, lastly, you must remember that it took place in an England the
population of which was hardly more than a sixth—some people would say
it was hardly more than a tenth—of to-day’s, and that population
actually a great deal poorer on the average than the present population
of England. It is true that there was not then the great herd of
starving or half-starving people which we have to-day in England, and
that labouring people were then much better off than they are now; but,
on the other hand, there was nothing like the same number of very rich
people, and therefore the average family income was much smaller. Put
all that together, and it is clear what a tremendous business the
confiscation of this one Abbey meant. It was somewhat as though the
Government to-day were to confiscate one of the smaller railway
companies, or to take away the rentals now paid by a northern
manufacturing town to the great landlords owning the soil, and put the
money into its own pocket.</p>
<p>From this example of the confiscation of the Abbey of Westminster you
can argue to all the other expenditure of the time—expenditure on armies
and navies, and so on—and in this way you can see <em>how, why and in
what degree the social value of money differs between one period and
another.</em></p>
<p>It is most important to get this point in Economics clear in your
mind if you are reading history, because it helps to explain all manner
of things which otherwise puzzle one in the past.</p>

<section id="usury" class="level2">
<h2>Usury</h2>
<p>Usury, the last subject but one on which I am going to touch in this
book, is one which modem people have almost entirely forgotten, and
which you will not find mentioned in any book on Economics that I know.
Yet its vital importance was recognised throughout all history until
quite lately, and it is already forcing itself upon modem people’s
notice whether they like it or no. So it is as well to understand it
betimes, for it is going to be discussed very widely in the near
future.</p>
<p>All codes of law and all writers on morals from the beginning of
anything we know about human society have denounced as wrong the
practice of <em>Usury.</em></p>
<p>They have recognised that this practice does grave harm to the State
and to society as a whole, and must, therefore, as far as possible, be
forbidden.</p>
<p>Now what is Usury, and why does it thus do harm?</p>
<p>Modem people have so far forgotten this exceedingly important matter
that they have come to use the word “usury” loosely for “the taking of
high interest upon a loan.” That is very muddled thinking indeed, as you
will see in a moment. The character of Usury <em>has nothing to do with
the taking of high or low interest.</em> It is concerned with something
quite different.</p>
<p><em>Usury is the taking of any interest whatever upon an</em>
<strong>unproductive</strong> <em>loan.</em></p>
<p>A man comes to you and says: “Lend me this piece of capital which you
possess” (for instance, a ship, and stores of food with which to feed
the sailors during the voyage of the ship). “Using this piece of capital
to transport the surplus goods from this country over the sea and to
bring back foreign goods which we need here I shall make a profit so
large that I can exchange it for at least one hundred tons of wheat. The
voyage there and back will take a year.”</p>
<p>You naturally answer: “It is all very well for you to make a profit
of one hundred tons of wheat in one year by the use of <em>my</em> ship
and of <em>my</em> stores of food for sailors who work the ship, but
what about me? I grant you ought to have part of this profit for
yourself, as you are taking all the trouble. But I ought to have
<em>some,</em> because the ship and stores of food are mine; and unless
I lent them to you (since you have none of your own) you would not be
able to make that profit by trading of which you speak. Let us go half
shares. You shall have fifty tons of wheat and I will take fifty, out of
the total profit of one hundred tons.”</p>
<p>The man who proposed to borrow your ship agrees. The bargain is
struck, and when the year is over you make a fifty tons profit of wheat
on your capital.</p>
<p>That is <em>the earning of interest on a productive loan.</em></p>
<p>There is nothing morally wrong about that transaction at all. It does
no one any harm. It does not weaken the State or society, or even hurt
any individual. There is a sheer gain due to wise exchange (which is
equivalent to production); everybody is benefited—you that own the
capital, the man who uses it, and all society, which benefits by the
foreign exchange. Supposing your ship and stores of food were worth a
hundred tons of wheat, then your profit of fifty tons of wheat is a
profit of 50%, which is very high indeed. But you have a perfect right
to it: your capital has produced a real increase of wealth to that
extent. If your capital be worth ten times as much, then your profit is
only 5% instead of 50%. But your moral right to the 50% is just as great
as your moral right to the 5%. No one can blame you, and you are doing
no harm.</p>
<p>Now supposing that, instead of coming to ask you for the loan of your
ship, the man came and asked you for the loan of a sum of money which
you happened to have by you and which would be sufficient to buy and
stock the ship. It is clear that the transaction remains exactly the
same. The loan is <em>productive.</em> He makes a true profit, that is,
there is a real increase of wealth for the community, and you and he
have a right to take your shares out of it—you because you are the owner
of the capital, and he because he took the trouble of organising and
overlooking the expedition.</p>
<p>These are examples of profit on a <em>productive</em> loan.</p>
<p>Now suppose a man to come to you if you were a baker and say: “Lend
me half a dozen loaves. My family have no bread and I cannot see my way
to earning anything for a day or two. But when I begin to earn I will
get another half dozen loaves and see that you are not out of pocket.”
Then if you were to reply: “I will not let you have half a dozen loaves
on those terms. I will let you owe me the bread for a month if you like,
but at the end of the month you must give me back <em>seven</em>
loaves”: that would be usury.</p>
<p>The man is not using the loan productively; he is consuming the
loaves immediately. No more wealth is created by the act. The world is
not the richer, nor are you the richer, nor is society in general the
richer. No more wealth at all has appeared through the transaction.
Therefore the extra loaf that you are claiming is claimed out of
nothing. It has to come out of the wealth of the community—in this
particular case out of the wealth of the man who borrowed the
loaves—instead of coming out of an increment or excess or new wealth.
That is why usury is called “usury”—which means: “wearing down,”
“gradually dilapidating.”</p>
<p>It is clear that if the whole world practised usury and nothing but
usury, if wealth were never lent to be used productively, but only to be
consumed unproductively, and yet were to demand interest on the
unproductive transaction, then the wealth that was lent would soon eat
up all the other wealth in the community until you came to a situation
in which there was no more to take. Everyone would be ruined except
those who lent; then these, having no more blood to suck, would die
themselves, and society would end.</p>
<p>As in the case of the ship, it matters not in the least whether the
actual thing, the loaves of bread, are. lent, or money is lent with
which to buy them. <em>The test is whether the loan is productive or
not.</em> The <em>intention</em> of Usury is present <em>when the money
is lent at interest on what the lender</em> <strong>knows</strong>
<em>will be an unproductive purpose,</em> and the actual <em>practice of
usury is present when the loan, having as a fact been used
unproductively, interest is none the less demanded.</em></p>
<p>As in every other case of right and wrong whatsoever, there is, of
course, a broad margin in which it is very difficult to draw the line. A
man guilty of usury and trying to excuse himself might say, even in the
case of food lent to a starving man: “The loan may not look directly
productive, but indirectly it was productive, for it saved the man’s
life and thus later on he was able to work and produce wealth.”</p>
<p>The other way about (though there is not much danger of that
nowadays), a man trying to get out of interest on a productive loan
might say in many cases: “The loan was not really productive. It is true
I made a profit on it, but that profit was not additional wealth for the
community. It only represented what I got out of somebody else on a
bargain.”</p>
<p>In this margin of uncertainty we have only common sense to guide us,
as in every other similar case. We know pretty well in each particular
example we come across whether a loan is productive of not; whether we
are borrowing or lending for a productive purpose, or for a charitable
or luxurious one, or for one in every way unproductive.</p>
<p>The proof that this feeling about usury is right is to be found in
the private conduct of individuals in their social relations. If a poor
man in distress goes to a rich friend and borrows ten pounds, he pays it
back when he can; and the rich man would think it dishonourable to
charge interest. But if a man borrowed ten pounds of one for the purpose
of doing something which was likely to increase its value, and we knew
that this was his purpose, we should have a perfect right to share the
results with him, and no one would think the claim dishonourable.</p>
<p>Usury, then, is essentially a claim to increment, or extra wealth,
<em>which is not there to be claimed.</em> It is a practice which
diminishes the capital wealth of the needy and eats it up to the profit
of the lender; so that, if usury go unchecked, it must end in the
absorption of all private property into the hands of a few money
brokers.</p>
<p>Now, these things being so, the nature of usury being pretty clear,
and both the moral wrong of it and the injury it does to society being
equally clear, how is it that the modem world for so long forgot all
about it, and how is it that it is forcing itself upon the attention of
the modern world again in spite of that forgetfulness?</p>
<p>I will answer both of those questions.</p>
<p>The wrong and the very nature of usury came to be forgotten with the
great expansion of financial dealings which arose in the middle and end
of the seventeenth century—that is, about 250 years ago—in Europe. In
the simpler times, when commercial transactions were open and upon a
comparatively small scale, and done between men who knew each other, you
could pretty usually tell, as you can in private life, whether a loan
were a loan required for a productive or an unproductive purpose. The
burden of proof lay upon the lender. It was no excuse in lending a man
money to say: “I did not know what he wanted to do with it, so I charged
him 10%, thinking that very probably he was going to use it
productively.” The courts of justice would not admit such a plea, and
they were quite right. For under the simple conditions of the old days
the judge would answer: ” It was your business to know. A man does not
come borrowing money unless he is in either personal necessity or has
some productive scheme for which he wants to use the money. If you
thought it was a productive scheme you would certainly have asked him
about it in order to share the profits, and the fact that you did not
trouble to find out whether it were productive or no shows that you are
indifferent to the wrong of usury, and willing to do that wrong under
the pretence that it was not your business to inquire.”</p>
<p>The attitude of the law on money-lending in the old days was very
much what it is to-day with regard to certain poisonous chemicals which
may be used well or ill. The seller of those chemicals has to ask what
they are going to be used for, and is responsible if he fails to
inquire. In the same way the old Christian law said a lender was bound
to find out if his loan were intended for production or not. If the law
had not done this, then usury would have been universal and would have
eaten up the State, to the profit of the few people who lent out their
money: as it is doing now.</p>
<p>But as trade became more and more complicated and much larger and
lost its personal character, as the banking system arose on a large
scale and great companies with any number of shareholders, and as it
became impossible to lay the weight of proof upon the lender—when,
indeed, most lenders could not know for what their money was being lent,
but only that they had put it into some financial institution with the
object of fructifying it—then the opportunity for Usury came in, and it
soon permeated all commerce.</p>
<p>Suppose a man to-day, for instance, to put money into an Insurance
Company. It pays him, let us say, 5% interest on his money. He does not
know, and cannot know—no one can know—exactly how that particular bit of
money is being used It is merged in the whole lump of the funds the
Insurance Company has to deal with. A great deal of it will be used
productively. It will go to the purchase of steam engines and stores of
food, ships, and so on, which in use increase the wealth of the world;
and the money spent in buying these things has a perfect right to profit
and does no harm to anyone by taking profit. But a certain proportion
will be used unproductively. The original investor knows nothing about
that, and even the managers of the company know nothing about it.</p>
<p>A client comes to them and says: “I want a loan of a thousand
pounds.” They are quite unable, under modern conditions, to go into an
examination of what he is going to do with it. He gives security and
gets his loan. He may be a man in distress who gets-it in order to pay
his debts, or he may be a man who is going to start a business. The
company cannot go into that. It has to make a general rule of so much
interest upon what it lends, under the implied supposition, of course,
that the loan is normally productive. But the borrower can U9e it
unproductively, and often does and intends to do so.</p>
<p>Thus, with a very large volume of impersonal business, the presence
of usury is inevitable. But though inevitable, and though therefore the
practice of it, being indirect and distant, cannot be imputed to this
man or that, usury inevitably produces its disastrous effects, and the
modern world is at last coming to feel those effects very sharply.</p>
<p>A few pence lent out at usury some twenty centuries ago would amount
now, at compound interest, to more wealth than there is in the whole
world; which is a sufficient proof that usury is unjust and, as a
permanent trade method, impossible.</p>
<p>The large proportion of usurious payments which are now being made on
account of the impersonal and indirect character of nearly all
transactions, is beginning to lay such a burden upon the world as a
whole that there is danger of a breakdown.</p>
<p>If you keep on taking wealth as though from an increase, when really
there is no increase out of which that wealth can come, the process
must, sooner or later, come to an end. It is as though you were to claim
a hundred bushels of apples every year from an orchard after the orchard
had ceased to bear, or as though you were to claim a daily supply of
water from a spring which had dried up. The man who would have to pay
the apples would have to get them as best he could, but by the time the
claim was being made on all the orchards of the world, by the time that
usury was asking a million bushels of apples a year, though only half a
million were being produced, there would be a jam. The interest would
not be forthcoming, and the machinery for collecting it would stop
working. Long before it actually stopped, of course, people would find
increasing difficulty in getting their interest and increasing trouble
would appear in all the commercial world.</p>
<p>Now that is exactly what is beginning to happen to-day after about
two centuries of usury and one century of unrestricted usury. So far we
have got out of it by all manner of makeshifts. Those who have borrowed
the money and have promised to pay, say, 5%, are allowed to change and
to pay only 2.5%. Or, by the process of debasing currency, which I
described earlier in this book, the value of the money is changed, so
that a man who has been set down to pay, say, a hundred sheep a year, is
really only paying 50 or 30 sheep a year. A more drastic method is the
method of “writing off” loans altogether—simply saying: “I simply cannot
get my interest, and so I must stop asking for it.” That is what happens
when a Government goes bankrupt, as the Government of Germany has
done.</p>
<p>If you look at the Usury created by the Great War, you will see this
kind of thing going on on all sides. The Governments that were fighting
borrowed money from individuals and promised interest upon it. Most of
that money was not used productively: it was used for buying wheat and
metal, and machinery and the rest, but the wheat was not used to feed
workmen who were producing more wealth. It was used to feed soldiers who
were producing no wealth, and so were the ships and the metal and the
machinery, etc. Therefore when the individuals who had lent the money
began collecting from the Government interest upon what they had lent
they were asking every year for wealth which simply was not there, and
the Governments have got out of their promise to pay a usurious interest
in all sorts of ways—some by repudiating, that is saying that they
<em>would</em> not pay (the Russians have done that), others by debasing
currency in various degrees. The English Government has cut down what it
promised to pay to about half, and by taxing this it has further reduced
it to rather less than a third. The French Government, by inflation and
by taxation, have reduced it much more—to less than a fourth, or perhaps
more like a sixth or an eighth.</p>
<p>The Germans have reduced it by inflation to pretty well nothing,
which is the same really as repudiating the debt altogether.</p>
<p>So what we see in a general survey is this:—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Usury is both wrong morally and bad for society, <em>because it
is the claim for an increase of wealth which is not really present at
all.</em> It is trying to get something where there is nothing out of
which that something can be paid.</p></li>
<li><p>This action must therefore progressively and increasingly soak up
the wealth which men produce into the hands of those who lend money,
until at last all the wealth is so soaked up and the process comes to an
end.</p></li>
<li><p>That is what has happened in the case of the modern world,
largely through unproductive expenditure on war, which expenditure has
been met by borrowing money <em>and promising interest upon it although
the money was not producing any further wealth.</em></p></li>
<li><p>The modem world has therefore reached a limit in this process and
the future of usurious investment is in doubt.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Though these conclusions are perfectly clear, it is unfortunately not
possible to say that this or that is a way out of our difficulties; that
by this or that law we can stop usury in the future and can go back to
healthier conditions. Trade is still spread all over the world. It is
still impersonal and money continues to be lent out at interest
unproductively, with the recurring necessity of repaying the debt and
failing to keep up payments which have been promised. Things will not
get right again in this respect until society becomes as simple as it
used to be, and we shall have to go through a pretty bad time before we
get back to that.</p>

<section id="economic-imaginaries" class="level2">
<h2>Economic Imaginaries</h2>
<p>I am going to end with a rather difficult subject on which I
hesitated whether I should put it into this book or no. If you find it
too difficult leave it out; but if you find as you read that you can
understand it it is worth going into, because it is quite new (you will
not find it in any other book), and it is very useful in helping one to
understand certain difficult problems which have arisen in our modern
society and which have become a danger to-day. This subject is what I
call “Economic Imaginaries.”</p>
<p>An imaginary is a term taken from mathematics, and means a value
which appears on paper but has no real existence. It would be too long
and much too puzzling to explain what imaginaries in mathematics are,
but I can give you a very simple example of what they are in Economics.
They mean economic values or lumps of wealth which appear on paper when
you are making calculations, so that one would think the wealth was
really there, but which when you go closely into their nature you find
do not really exist.</p>
<p>The first example I will give you is that of a man who, having a
large income, gives an allowance to his son living somewhere abroad.
Supposing a man in England has £10,000 a year, and he has put his son
into business in Paris, but because the young man has not yet learned
his business, and is still being helped from home, he allows that son
£1,000 a year to spend.</p>
<p>When the Income Tax people go round finding out what everybody has
they put down the rich man in England, quite rightly, as having £10,000
a year, and when the value of all incomes in England is <em>assessed,
i.e.,</em> when a table is drawn up showing what the total income of all
Englishmen is, this man appears, quite properly, as having £10,000 a
year. But when the people in France make a similar <em>assessment,</em>
to find out what the incomes are of all the people living in France, the
rich man’s son in Paris appears as having £1,000 a year. So when the
assessments of England and France are added together and some Government
economist is calculating what the total income of the citizens of both
countries may be, <em>that £1,000 a year appears twice.</em> One of
these appearances is an <em>economic imaginary.</em> In other words, by
the method of calculation used, £1,000 every year appears on the total
assessment of England and also of France, making £2,000 of £1,000. The
extra £1,000, though appearing on paper, does not really exist at all:
it is an “Economic Imaginary.”</p>
<p>This is the simplest case of an economic imaginary. It is the case
overlap, or counting of the same money twice, and we may put down this
case in general terms by saying: “Every unchecked overlap creates an
economic imaginary to the extent of that unchecked overlap.”</p>
<p>It looks so simple that one might say, “Well, surely everybody would
notice that!” But it is very much the other way—even in this simple
case. The more complicated society becomes, the more payments there are
back and forth, allowances and pensions and all sorts of arrangements
which grow up with increased travel and means of communication and, in
general, with the development of society, the more these overlaps come
into being and remain unchecked, that is, uncorrected, the greater
number there are in which people are not aware that there is an overlap,
or if it is an overlap do not remember to mention it, or if they do
mention it are not believed. In general the more society increases in
complexity the more this kind of economic imaginary by mere overlap
increases in proportion to the total real wealth, and the more the total
“assessment” of the community is exaggerated.</p>
<p>I will give you one instance, to prove this, which is very striking
and which happened in my own experience. A man I knew gave in his income
tax returns a few years ago. He had a secretary at home to whom he paid
a fairly large salary, and he also used a secretary in town. Their
salaries came out of money which he had earned in business but appeared
in his taxable general income, for he was not allowed to take it off as
an expense. Meanwhile, both the secretary in the country and the
secretary in town were paying tax on <em>their</em> salaries, though
they came out of a total income which had already paid taxes, and anyone
making an assessment of the total income of England would certainly have
written down from the official books: “Mr. Blank, so much a year; his
secretary A—, so much a year; his secretary B—, so much a year,” and
added up the total. Yet it is clear that the money put down to A and B
was imaginary.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you the thousands of ways in which this simple case of
overlapping goes on in modem England, for it would be too long to
explain, and I have only given you very simple instances, but you may be
certain that the economic imaginaries of this kind form at least a
quarter of the supposed income of the country.</p>
<p>If there were no other form of imaginaries than this it would be very
simple to understand them, and perhaps allow for them in making an
estimate of total wealth. Unfortunately, there are any number of
different forms much more difficult to seize and cropping up like
mushrooms everywhere more and more in a complicated and active
society.</p>
<p>For instance: you have (2) the economic imaginary due to
<em>luxurious expenditure.</em></p>
<p>All over the world where you have rich people spending money
foolishly they are asked, for things that they buy, prices altogether
out of keeping with the real value of the things. If you go into one of
the big hotels in London or Paris and have a dinner the <em>economic
values</em> you consume are anything from a quarter to a tenth of the
sum you are asked to pay. Thus people who buy a bottle of champagne in
this sort of place pay from a pound to thirty shillings. The economic
values contained in a bottle of champagne, that is the economic values
which are built up by the labour of all sorts which has been expended in
producing it, come to about two shillings and sixpence. So when people
pay from a pound to thirty shillings for a bottle of champagne they are
paying from eight to twelve times the real economic values which are
destroyed in consumption. There is an extra margin of anything from
seventeen shillings and sixpence to twenty-seven shillings and sixpence,
which is an <em>economic imaginary</em> in that one case alone. And
remember that this economic imaginary goes the rounds. It appears in the
profits of the Hotelkeeper, which are assessed in the total national
income for taxation. It appears in the rent for his hotel, since a man
will pay much more rent for a house in which he can get people to pay
these sums than for a humbler hotel of the same size and of the same
true economic value in bricks and mortar. It appears in the rates which
the hotel pays to the local authorities, and which in their turn appear
in the income of humble officials living in the suburbs. That economic
imaginary created by the silly person who is willing to pay from a pound
to thirty shillings for a thing worth two shillings and sixpence appears
over and over again in the various assessments of the country.</p>
<p>Here is another case (3): <em>economic imaginaries due to inequality
of income.</em></p>
<p>Supposing you have a thousand families with £1,000 a year each; that
is, a total income among them of £1,000,000 a year. Supposing you put up
for competition among those families a very beautiful picture which
everybody would like to have; painted, say, by Van Dyck. None of these
people with £1,000 a year each could afford to give more than a certain
sum for the picture, and probably, when they had competed for it, it
would fetch no more than £100. An official estimating that community
would say that it had £1,000,000 a year income, such and such values in
houses, etc., and that there was a picture present worth £100, and all
that would go down in his estimates or “Assessment.”</p>
<p>Now supposing all but two of these thousand families to be
impoverished by having to pay rents and interest to these two men.
Supposing they were all reduced to just under £500 a year, and that the
balance of £500,000 were paid to those other two. Then each of these
would have £250,000 a year. The Van Dyck is put up for auction in this
community. The poor families, of course, have no show at all. Not one of
them can afford more than £50 at the most, however much he wanted the
Van Dyck. But the two rich men can compete one against the other
recklessly. They have an enormous margin of wealth with which to do what
they like, and the Van Dyck between them may be rushed up to
£50,000.</p>
<p>There is not a penny more of real wealth in the community than there
was before. Yet your Government assessor would come down and assess the
community in a very different fashion from the way in which he would
have assessed the first community. He will put down the total income at
£1,000,000, and the houses, furniture, etc., at so much, and he will
add: “Also a Van Dyck valued at £50,000.” Of course in real life, where
are great differences of income, this sort of thing is multiplied by the
thousand. It is another example of the way in which, as communities get
more complicated in a high civilisation, economic imaginaries
appear.</p>
<p>I am only introducing this subject as a very simple addition to this
little book, and I will not multiply instances too much, though one
might go on giving examples almost indefinitely.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a last one (4): <em>economic imaginaries due to the
confusion between services and economic values attached to material
things.</em></p>
<p>We saw at the beginning of this book that wealth did not consist in
<em>things,</em> such as coal, chairs, tables, etc., but in the
<em>economic values attached to those things;</em> that is, their added
use for the purposes of human beings up to the point where they were
beginning to be consumed. We saw how the coal in the earth has no
economic value, how it begins to be of value when it begins to be mined,
and how each piece of additional labour put into it to bring it nearer
to the point of consumption adds to its economic value, until at last,
when it gets into your cellar, from being worth nothing a ton (when it
was still in the earth) it is worth thirty shillings or forty shillings
a ton.</p>
<p>But when people assess wealth for the purpose of taxation, and in
order to find what (in their judgment) the total yearly income of a
nation is, they count not only the economic values attached to things
consumed by the nation, but also <em>services.</em></p>
<p>For instance: if Jones is a good card player, the rich man Smith may
pay him £500 a year to live in his house and amuse his loneliness by
perpetually playing cards with him. I knew a case of a man in South
Wales who did exactly that. It is an extreme case, but we all of us, all
day long, are paying money for services which do not add economic values
to things at all, and which yet must appear in assessment.</p>
<p>All the money I earn by writing is of this kind. Now assessment of
these services creates an enormous body of economic imaginaries, and to
show you how they may do so I will give you an extreme and ludicrous
case.</p>
<p>Supposing two men, one of whom, Smith, has a loaf of bread, and the
other of whom, Brown, has nothing. Smith says to Brown: “If you will
sing me a song I will give you my loaf of bread.” Brown sings his song
and Smith hands over the bread. A little later Brown wants to hear Smith
sing and he says to him: “If you will sing me a song I will give you
this loaf of bread.” A little later Smith again wants to have a song
from Brown. Brown sings his song (let us hope a new one!) and the loaf
of bread again changes hands and so on all day.</p>
<p>Supposing each of these transactions to be recorded in a book of
accounts. There will appear in Smith’s book: “Paid to Brown for singing
songs two hundred loaves of bread,” and in Brown’s book: “Paid to Smith
for singing songs two hundred loaves of bread.” The official who has to
assess the national income will laboriously copy these figures into his
book and will put down: “Daily income of Smith, 200 loaves of bread.
Daily income of Brown, 200 loaves of bread. Total 400 loaves of bread.”
Yet there is only one <em>real</em> loaf of bread there all the time!
The other 399 are imaginary.</p>
<p>Now with a ludicrous and extreme example of this sort you may say: ”
That is all very well as a joke, but it has no bearing on real life.” It
has. That is exactly the sort of thing which is going on the whole time
in a highly-developed economic society. I go to a matinee and pay 10s.
for a man to amuse me. He goes of! himself in the evening and pays ios.
to hear a man sing at a concert. Next morning that man (I sincerely
hope) buys one of my books, and a big part of the price is not paid for
the economic values attaching to the material of it, but for the
services of writing it, which is not a creation of wealth at all. The
publisher pays me my royalty, and I spend part of it in looking at an
acrobat in a music hall. The acrobat pays ios. to keep up his chapel;
and the minister of the chapel, in a fit of fervour, pays a subscription
of ios. to a political party.</p>
<p>And so on. Here is a short chain of economic imaginaries: 50s.—five
ten-shilling notes—all appearing one after the other in the assessment
of the national income and corresponding to no real wealth.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same thing in principle as the case of the two men
singing for one loaf of bread. And the same principle applies to the
expenditure of rates and taxes. A great part of this expenditure goes in
empty services, not in services which add economic values to things.</p>
<p>We must, of course, distinguish between two things which many of the
older economists muddled up. A thing may be of the highest temporal use
to humanity in the production of happiness, such as good singing, or of
high spiritual value, such as good conduct, and yet that thing must not
be confounded with economic values. When one says, for instance, that
good singing, or a good picture, or a good book has no economic value,
or only a very slight material economic value (the best picture ever
painted has probably not a true economic value of more than 20s. outside
its frame, unless the painter used expensive paints or a quite enormous
canvas) one does not mean, as too many foolish people imagine, that
<em>therefore</em> one ought not to have good singing, or good pictures,
or the rest of it.</p>
<p>What (is) meant is that the examination of any one set of things must
be kept separate from the examination of another, and when you put down
the money spent on these things as though it represented real economic
values you are making a false calculation.</p>
<p>Well, this is only a hint of quite a new subject in Economics, which
I have put in at the end in the hope that it may be of some value to
you. Meditate upon it. As societies get more and more luxurious, more
and more complicated, more and more “civilised” (as we call it), so do
these economic imaginaries grow out of all proportion to the real wealth
of the society. If on the top of their growth you suddenly impose high
taxation, based upon your assessment, you may think that you are only
taking a fifth or a third or a fourth of the whole community’s real
yearly wealth, when in reality you are taking a half or more than a
half. And this is probably the main reason why so many highly developed
societies have broken down towards the end of their brilliance through
the demands of their tax-gatherers who worked on assessment inflated out
of all reality by a mass of economic imaginaries.</p>
